**Time**/**Date**: 7. March from **7-8:30pm**  in **ECCR 265**

Overview and Rules  
--------
- The exam covers everything we have done in class up to and including Neural Networks.  This includes all material presented in lecture, in-class discussion, Hands-On notebooks, and material introduced in homework. 
- You are allowed one 8-1/2 x 11in sheet of **handwritten** notes (both sides).  No magnifying glasses! 
- You may use a calculator provided that it cannot access the internet or store large amounts of data. 
- The exam will be a mixture of multiple choice questions and free-response questions in which you may be asked to work through simple examples of algorithms
