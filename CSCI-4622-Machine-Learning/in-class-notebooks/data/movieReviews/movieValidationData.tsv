0	Almost as tedious to watch as it was to read Evening is a gorgeously produced failure until Meryl Streep walks in and quietly shows her other cast members how to act this kind of stuff Vanessa Redgrave is shockingly off in her role as the dying Ann and Claire Danes is a cipher Perhaps if Vanessa and Claire had switched roles we could have seen the vibrancy in the young Ann that gave her entr e to the rarefied world of the story and we could have imagined that the older Ann actually was dying I was hoping the addition of Michael Cunningham to the writing credits would smooth out the jumpy storytelling but alas It gave me a headache
0	If you enjoy the original SNL cast and shows then avoid this movie at all costs When this first came out my friends and I waited in line for over an hour to get in to a sold out movie house half way through the movie the theatre was empty We refused to leave thinking it would get better When the movie ended we were the only ones left in the theatre The movie lasted only one day in all theaters then vanished from sight In interviews with Mr Mike he refused to comment on this film The film was an inside joke on the episodes of SNL that came out right after the films release and closing in one day We all tried to contact Mr Mike by phone and mail to get a refund but were totally ignored
1	Home Room deals with a Columbine like high school shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors their trauma guilt and denial Spoilers The shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage SWAT commando after shooting the high school killer The film has three protagonists the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident played by a very young Erika Christensen and Busy Philipps The two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensues Erika Christensen though only has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting Busy Philipps three years older than Christensen and altogether unknown to me blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence This girl was the part It s a great movie and it connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls Gus van Sant s Elephant though good seems almost superficial and paltry compared to Home Room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting What I can see this film got very little screen time and exposure so much more a loss for an equally traumatized America Ten out of Ten
0	This movie is just boring It tries to copy some effects borrowed to a creative director like Jeunet in Am lie Poulain but it is too much The dialogs are pretty bad some of the worst I have ever heard Guillaume Canet is not convincing I have almost never found him very convincing his father in the movie plays very badly the story is dumb the ending is stupid I think I have not dislike a movie so much since le pacte des loups brotherhood of the wolf from Christophe Gans and I watch see about movies a year but at least that movie had some action and lots of good actors I had never commented here only rated and when I saw the rating and the comments I thought I had to write something down I guess we won t have problems to sell the DVD we were offered not such a bad movie in our large collection I am open minded I watch SF westerns drama comedies silents horror fantasy movies but this movie was so boring that I felt like I had lost one hour and a half
1	I enjoyed this film perhaps because I had not seen any reviews etc It was delightful and a little bit of a romp I don t know why it didn t make more of a splash than it did As far as the story goes I could relate to some aspects of the Paul Reiser character and I could see my dad in Falk s character Made me remember a lot of past times when I was a kid and listening to my grandparents too If you enjoyed movies like Grumpy Old Men or On Golden Pond this is your movie A sleeper in my opinion and one of those feel good stories Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had many wonderful verbal tussles yet nothing was overdone I would say it rates at least an perhaps higher
0	Considering the limits of this film The entire movie in one setting a music studio only about or actors total it should have been much better made IF you have these limits in making a film how could the lighting be so bad And the actors were terrible were talking a hair below the acting in Clerks except that was an enjoyable movie this had no substance Well it tried to but really fails It makes attempt to be self referencing in a couple parts but the lines were delivered so poorly by the actors it was just bad And the main character Neal guy what a pathetic looser Clearly like people total made this film and they all knew each other and it probably was a real rock band that they had but unfortuntly these people really have no idea how terrible they are all around This was made in but they all look so naieve it smacks of just pre grunge era Thankfully I didn t pay to see this Starz on Demand delivers again but it was under the title The Possessed not Studio it doesn t matter what you do to the title it can t help this This could have been a much better made movie there is no excuse for this bad film making when you have the obvious limited parameters the filmmakers had when they made this working within those limits you should make the stuff you can control and the stuff you can work with the best you can Instead they figured mediocrity would be good enough And that music video wow that was bad I fast fowarded through that So is fair if you are into the whole b movie crap I suppose you ll go and see this
0	What the is this This must without a doubt be the biggest waste of film settings and camera ever I know you can t set your expectations for an s slasher high but this is too stupid to be true I baught this film for and I still feel the urge to go claim my money back Can you imagine who hard it STINKS Who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations Well actually you couldn t possible care less And why should you The makers of this piece of garbage sure didn t care They didn t try to create a tiny bit of tension The director Stephen Carpenter I guess it s much easier to find money with a name like that also made the Kindred wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did Soul Survivors Complete crap as well but at least that one had Eliza Dushku This junk has the debut of Daphne Zuniga Who Yeah that s right the Melrose Place chick Her very memorable character dies about min after the opening credits She s the second person to die The first victim dies directly in the first minute but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares The rest of the actors they don t deserve the term actors actually are completely uninteresting You re hoping they die a quick and painful death and not only their charactersMy humble opinion
0	I m so confused I ve been a huge Seagal fan for years I ve seen all of his films and many of those dozens of times I can only describe this film as bizarre Steven Seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film but I have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines with a thin whiny imposter s voice no less What I also don t get is if they had to dub SOME of his lines why does his own voice appear on the rest of them I expect Seagal to age like the rest of us But the Seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger confidence bravado charm and sex appeal he so easily showed us in ALL of his previous movies What I found myself missing most of all was his cocky self assured attitude and his bad ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin Where is that in your face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star I hope that this film is not an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us if so his lifelong fans will have to concede that the Seagal we all knew and loved is gone
1	STAR RATING The Works Just Misses the Mark That Little Bit In Between Lagging Behind The Pits Mike Atherton Dudikoff is peacefully making his way in the Wild West when he spots a group of men mistreating a lady Being a gentleman he naturally steps in and puts a stop to this and in doing so kills the son of a nasty enforcer This is just the beginning of a all guns blazing battle to the finish from which there will be only one winner M Dudikoff is an action star who s never truly managed to take off with me Maybe I discovered him too late and after the other film I saw with him in it last Monday The Human Shield it was just another Dud ha ha added to the list But I have a thing for westerns being films that just sort of transport me to a different time and place and provide real escapist entertainment and with this Dudikoff has picked one of his better scripts as his films go anyway The film hits a few low points in the shape of a naff central villain sounding like a blank Marlon Brando and some generally ropey acting from some of the cast along with the obligatory cheap looking sets But if for some strange reason your life ever depended on watching a Dudikoff film this would be one of your best choices
1	My very favorite character in films but in nearly all of them the character of Zorro has a small bit of cloth as a mask and if the villain s can t tell who is under that cloth then they are daft But in Reed Hadley s Zorro s Fighting Legion serial the mask fills his whole face making it a real mystery as to who Zorro really is But anyway Zorro is one of the best character s in films and to bring it up to date l think Anthony Hopkins in The Mask of Zorro is a delight My interest in films is vast but l have a real liking for the serial s of the s s Bond a
0	What begins as a fairly clever farce about a somewhat shady security monitoring company turns almost instantaneously into an uninteresting and completely inane murder mystery David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci try mightily to make this train wreck watchable but some things are just not humanly possible What for instance causes Gale to turn suddenly from a sweet motherly figure into a drunken shrew at Tommy s parents house Why would Heinrich although admittedly a sleezebag want to destroy the business to which he devotes his life by robbing and possibly murdering his customers Why does the seemingly sensible Tommy believe that Heinrich could be a murderer based almost entirely on a dream and even if that were believable why wouldn t he go to the police And why didn t Gale activate the alarm when she got home especially after scolding Howie about it being off Of course all of these events are necessary for the plot and I use the term very very loosely to unfold And it might be forgivable if it resulted in even the slightest bit of comedy But everything from Howie s description of his date rape to the coroner s misidentification of Gale to the final joke about Gale and Howie still being dead is more tasteless and pathetic than anything else I checked the box indicating that my comments contained spoilers but there s nothing more I or anyone else could do to spoil this thing that already stinks to high heaven
1	I like it because of my recent personal experience Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite The characters in the firm did not really enjoy their real lives but they did enjoy themselves i e what they were The movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory A good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life Many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those Before Sunrise dealt with it in a nice way which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film Before Sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head It just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities This made the conversations between the characters interesting not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas You would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story The end was not quite important after all You could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie Movies are supposed to be enjoyable This is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it I am on a journey too The movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions
1	Perhaps not the absolute greatest entry in the Hammer House of Horror series but it surely wins the award for most inventively titled episode The House that Bled to Death I could yell out this title all day without ever getting tired of it And besides the wondrous title this short movie also benefices from a solidly written screenplay and a handful of genuinely suspenseful moments It might require an extra viewing before you fully understand the peculiar end twist but it s definitely an original idea for a horror short The story opens with images of an elderly couple drinking tea in their middle class house The husband sadistically kills his wife and several years later the cursed house is still for sale A young couple and their cherubic daughter move in and start to restore it but mysterious events occur and affect especially the young Sophie Her beloved cat is killed an even her birthday party gets ruined when one of the house s pipes suddenly sprays blood all over the guests a particularly chilling sequence this one Is the old house really haunted Or maybe the seemly helpful neighbors cause all the horror The answers to these questions are provided in the original and fairly unpredictable climax and there s even room for a real shock at the very end The tension is masterfully built up and the titular house is filled with eerie scenery like the pair of rusty machetes used by the husband to slay his wife Little warning though the sequence with the cat is hard to watch when you re an animal lover In conclusion another winner for Hammer s short running TV series
1	This is a good movie although people unfamiliar with the Modesty Blaise comics and books may find it a little slow and lacking in action For the Modesty fan the movie will be very enjoyable particularly because it is very faithful in its presentation of the Modesty Blaise history Peter O Donnell is listed in the credits as Creative Consultant and the film makers must have actually paid attention to him as the plot follows quite closely the details that have been presented in the comic books over the years although the events have been recast to modern days The only thing that the true fan may find disappointing is that there is no Willie Garvin in the story This lack of Willie is again just being faithful to the Modesty Blaise chronology since the movie takes place in the very early days of Modesty s career Alexandra Staden makes a very believable young Modesty who actually looks a lot like Modesty is supposed to look A welcome change from the travesty of the Monica Vitti portrayal of Modesty
1	There are so many good things to say about this B movie B maybe in connections but not in commission This is about the best of its genre that I have ever seen A grade A effort by Universal The script is well done imaginative and without fault Writing credits Howard Higgin original story Douglas Hodges story John Colton screenplay Director Lambert Hillyer handled the complex story and story locations very well No skimping on the loads of extras and locations I loved Beulah Bondy Jimmy Stewarts mother in It s A Wonderful Life The fem lead Frances Drake is a beauty and handled her part with grace and pathos for her Karloff husband Lugosi likewise was correctly underplayed I think this is the best part I remember seeing him in As I said there were so many good things the African discovery of the Radium X the melting of the stone statues somewhat reminiscent of the Ten Little Indians in And Then There Were None Agatha Christie the Barry Fitzgerald version the glowing of Karlof in the dark Karloff s mother played by Violet Kemble Cooper with elegance And because of all these virtues I found myself believing in the science it portrayed I guess that s the mark of a good piece of art
1	I am one of Jehovah s Witnesses and I also work in an acute care medical facility Over the years I have seen people die from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions have attended numerous conferences on blood born pathogens and have seen several patients become seriously ill from pathogens induced by transfused blood I have also heard several Jehovah s Witnesses being told that they will die if they refuse blood and after years in the field I have never actually seen it happen leaving the question is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or is the community at large benefiting from the battle on this issue The issue for Jehovah s Witnesses is a moral one You must abstain from blood is not an ambiguous statement Thank you for this movie and allowing comments on it
1	On the th of December in the Grand Caf in Paris film history was writing itself while Louis Lumi re showed his short films all single shots to a paying audience La Sortie des Usines Lumi re was the first film to be played and I wish I was there not only to see the film but also the reactions of the audience We start with closed doors of the Lumi re factory Apparently since the image seems a photograph people thought they were just going to see a slide show not something they were hoping for But then the doors open and people are streaming out heading home First a lot of women then some men and one man on a bike with a big dog When they are all out the doors close again Whether this is the first film or not some say L Arriv e d un Train la Ciotat was the first film Lumi re recorded it is an impressive piece of early cinema Being bored by this is close to impossible for multiple reasons One simple reason it is only fifty seconds long But also for people who normally only like the special effect films there must be something interesting here you don t get to see historical things like this every day
0	As other viewers have mentioned this film was an interesting experiment in photography The colors are comic book bold I think the director got carried away with his artistic vision over the look of the film instead o badly needed attention to content Despite its stellar cast the performances are lackluster and the story nearly incoherent Madonna was likely cast purely as a stunt to get pre release press A good thing as her appearance here lent some credence to her album I m Breathless Music inspired by the film Dick Tracy which was a stratospheric hit due in large part to the inclusion of dance hit Vogue which is not in nor has the slightest relation to this film I d guess the major portion of money from this film came from tie ins to Madonna s I m Breathless album If you watch it at home by end titles you ll think there s two hours out of my life I d like to have back Save yourself the wasted time do not bother with this
0	I have to say I was really looking forward on watching this film and finding some new life in it that would separate it from most dull and overly crafted mexican films I have no idea why but I trusted Sexo Pudor y Lagrimas to be the one to inject freshness and confidence to our non existent industry Maybe it was because the soundtrack which I listened to before I saw the film sounded different from others maybe it was because it dared to include newer faces apart from Demian Bichir who is always a favorite of mexican film directors and supposedly dealed within it s script with modern social behaviour maybe because it s photography I saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical The film turned out to be a major crowd pleaser and a major letdown What Serrano actually deals here with is the very old fashioned battle of the sexes as in all men are the same and why is it that all women blah blah blah Nothing new in it not even that it uses so much common ground and clich that it eventually mocks itself without leaving any valuable reflexion on the female male condition Full of usual tramps on the audience like safe gags about the clich s I talked about before those always work always and screaming performances it is a well acted film in it s context and by screaming I mean literally The at first more compelling characters played by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir turn out to be according to Serrano the more pathetic ones I completely disagree with Serrano they shouldn t have been treated that way only to serve as marionettes for his lesson to come through he made sure we got HIS message and completely destroyed their roles that were the only solid ground in which this story could have stood Anyway it is after all a very entertaining film at times and you will probably have a good time seeing it if you accept to be manipulated by it
0	Good Folks I stumbled on this film on evening while I was grading papers My academic specialty is Anglo Saxon literature and I can say that no one has ever done the genre the honor it deserves The Icelandic Beowulf and Grendel is the least offensive I have seen and I did pay for my copy This Sci Fi version ranks with the Christopher Lambert version Yuck What didn t I like CGI for one Amazingly bad More importantly is the faithfulness to the storyline not to mention the stilted acting I am used to both with all the versions I have seen Delighted Regardless Peter
1	Flat out the funniest spoof of pretentious art house films ever made This flick exposes all the clich s and then some Excruciatingly bad Downs Syndrome actors Terribly heavy self important dialog Scenes that are supposed to shock but fall flat Jarring editing Pointless plot points All wrapped up in a kind of smirky miasma of disrespect for the audience and vague psych drivel It achieves exactly what it was designed to A hilarious satire of those tedious movies made by spoiled teenage trust funders to show to their parents when they ask them what they ve been doing for the last two years After What Is It received its Cannes award presenter Werner Herzog was rumored to have been told that the film was in fact a spoof in part of his own films He supposedly blew up at the info To this day he refuses to discuss the incident Anyway see it and laugh this will be a classic of humor for many years to come
1	Ok needless to say this film is only going to appeal to a certain audience namely stoners and like minded people That being said if you are one of these aformentioned people this film is a MUST In fact I think it should be mandatory for head shops to sell a copy of it to anyone purchasing their first bong What Monty Python s Holy Grail is to geeks and nerds so is this movie to potheads I first saw this film years ago or so and I still crack up every time I watch it The jokes perfectly lampoon the pothead lifestyle far better than latter day knockoffs like Half Baked attempt to There isn t a plot so to speak the film is more of a collection of various skits as the films protagonists wander around Los Angeles in their legendary haze Despite this the film has an excellent sense of pace and doesn t drag at all Many people cite Up In Smoke as C C s best work but I would have to say that Next Movie is superior So if you re in the mood for an hour and half of belly laughs light up tune in and let your mind float away Oh and FREE TOMMY CHONG
0	Hmm IMDb rating of good comments bla bla okay two of my friends and me we orderd Pizza sat down and wanted to see something as cool as Ichi or at least something brainless but funny like Versus But Naked Blood sucked It s a complete waste Okay the scene with the woman who likes to eat is quite outstanding But that s it Nothing more nothing less I won t summerize the plot other people did already I just wanted to stop the hype But watch it and rate for yourself Maybe we can push the rating where it sould be One more thing that comes to my mind the soundtrack is even worse than Carpenter ever was okay John s cool
0	A remake of the superb movie of the stage play nicely casting Caine as the nemesis of his character from the first movie But doing nothing else nicely at all A under parr performance from the actors Law and Caine diluted further by weak self indulgent direction The warmth of the setting in the original is forsaken for a super modern homesetting The subtle interplay between Oliver and Caine which made the first movie so watchable is replaced with a horrid brash arrogance that instantly breeds disdain in the viewer But this is not the clever to ing and froing of liking one then the other character the original fostered so well this is an obvious OTT character assassination of both character from the word go This version of Sleuth is not really worth seeing watch the original film and be dazzled from the opening act
0	After Watergate Vietnam and the dark days of the Nixon and Jimmy Carter eras what the world needed was a good old fashioned chapter play hero taking on venomous serpents and evildoers in the America of or the jungles of South America in a series of fantastic cliffhanging adventures Unfortunately what it got in was Doc Savage The Man of Bronze Perhaps the best that can be said of legendary producer George Pal s final film is that his often beautifully designed but sadly flat adaptation of Kenneth Robeson s pulp paperback novels probably had George Lucas and Phil Kaufman leaving the theatre and saying to each other We can do better than that and adding a bullwhip a battered Fedora and some much needed character flaws to the mix A big part of the problem is that Doc Savage is in many ways even harder to write for than Superman explorer adventurer philanthropist a scientific and intellectual genius in the bronzed bleach blonde bulletproof muscle bound body of a Greek God or rather the form of TV s Tarzan Ron Ely a rather dull Charlton Heston clone here there s simply nothing he can t do and more damagingly nothing that can harm him The man is the virtual incarnation of Hitler s Aryan ubermensch no surprise that the DVD is only available in Germany albeit with all American values And just in case there should ever be anything he s overlooked not that there ever is he has not one but five sidekicks in his entourage the less than Fabulous Five A chemist an electrician and even an archaeologist I can accept and at a stretch I could possibly even go as far as to see the possible need for a construction engineer but what kind of hero takes a criminal lawyer with him on his adventures In reality Doc s brain trust were probably added because with the hero so tiresomely invulnerable and practically perfect in every way even Kryptonite wouldn t put a dent in him there needed to be someone at risk in the stories though with the exception of Paul Gleason they re all so horribly badly cast and overplayed as are most parts in the film you d happily kill them all off during the opening titles The villains fare no better with Paul Wexler exuding all the menace of a geography teacher as Captain Seas Scott Walker no a different one delivering one of cinema s worst accents is it meant to be Scottish Irish Welsh Greek Pakistani or some nationality no one has ever heard of while Robyn Hilton s Marilyn Monroe ish dumb blonde moll gives Paris no relation a run for her money in the untalented bimbo stakes Even with those drawbacks this should have been much better than it is considering the various ingredients lost tribes a pool of gold a dogfight with a biplane and a deadly poison that comes alive all wrapped up in a quest to discover why Doc s father was murdered Unfortunately it s a question of tone in the s and s pulp superheroes weren t brooding figures prone to state of the art action scenes and special effects but were treated as somewhat comical figures of low budget camp fun with action scenes quickly knocked off on the cheap almost as an afterthought the films aimed purely at the matin e market you know for kids There have long been rumours that the original cut was more straight faced and certainly much of the camp value has been added in post production be it the Colgate twinkle in Doc s eye the comical captions identifying various fighting styles in the final dust up with Captain Seas or Don Black s gung ho lyrics to John Philip Sousa s patriotic marches but plenty was in the film to begin with After all it s hard to see how one of the villain s underlings making phone calls from a giant rocking crib was ever intended as anything other than a joke that falls flat while Doc s explanation to Pamela Hensley of why he never dates girls could be a scene written for Adam West s Batman Instead the funniest moments are usually purely unintentional such as Doc displaying his sixth sense by er bobbing his Adam s apple Perhaps an even bigger problem is that while promising on paper the action is handled in an almost relentlessly mundane fashion be it chasing a native assassin on the rooftops of New York skyscrapers or escaping from a yacht full of bad guys Even the winning notion of animated glowing green snakes swirling through the air as they poison their victims fails to raise any enthusiasm from director Michael Anderson having demonstrated their own invulnerability a couple of scenes earlier Doc manages to dispatch them with no more than a chair and an electric fan by simply pulling the curtains on them Still aside from Doc s various vehicles all stamped with his logo and looking more moulded plastic than bronze the production design is often rather handsome even if it is very obviously L A standing in for New York while Fred Koenekamp s cinematography ensures the film often looks good despite the low budget And it s good to see a superhero movie that doesn t spend most of its running time on an origin story though one is left with the suspicion that Doc sprang fully formed from the loins of Zeus himself It s a film I d really like to like more but it just feels like minutes of lost opportunities No wonder Doc Savage The Arch Enemy of Evil the sequel so optimistically promised in the end credits never happened
0	I read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions vary greatly I have to agree with those who found this movie to be awful It pains me to write that since I would have hoped this would have been great or I wouldn t have bothered to see it the other day I like supporting indie cinema especially if they are gay themed but this movie is almost too much to tolerate Those that walked out as I considered doing after about three minutes probably didn t mind shelling out or just figured it was going nowhere fast and not going to improve Maybe I am slightly more optimistic than they are either that or they didn t pay to get in in the first place Logan is bored He s a klutz He s gay I m okay with that The problem is that because the main character in a movie is bored does not necessarily mean that the movie about him has to be boring also There are ENDLESS scenes of this kid just laying around like a load of laundry re establishing everything that you already learned in the first scene and the second scene etc etc Nothing or no one goes anywhere NO ONE says anything even remotely insightful or funny or interesting Probably most appalling of all is that I didn t feel the slightest bit of empathy for Logan That in itself is a major accomplishment He didn t grow he didn t change he didn t learn there is no one to teach him anything he DIDN T DO ANYTHING and neither did the movie Scene after scene of the same thing do not a movie make Additionally the title makes no sense at all
0	I sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldn t take anymore It felt as though I d watched dozens of episodes already and then it hit me There s nothing new here I ve heard that joke on Seinfeld I saw someone fall like that on friends an episode of Happy Days had almost the same storyline ect None of the actors are interesting here either Some were good on other shows not here and others are new to a profession they should have never entered Avoid this stinker
0	Way to go ace You just made a chilling grossly intriguing story of a necrophiliac cannibal into a soft mellow drama Obviously a movie called Dahmer would be one of two kinds Horror or documentary right This was neither It wasn t close to any detailed facts in fact it barely had any substance at all It wasn t really morbid or scary or didn t even try to be very disturbing as if you would ve had to try What the hell was this writer director thinking Here s one of the most REAL examples of sick serial killers ever and we get badly shot poorly acted gay bar roofie rapes and lengthy droning flashbacks to alone time in his old parent s house I think Jacobson was actually trying to present or invent the soft side of j Dahmer
0	Lorne Michaels once again proves that he has absolutely no business producing movies You d think that after such dismal flicks Superstar Night at the Roxbury and Coneheads he d start to get the notion that maybe he doesn t know what he s doing when it comes to movies and many would argue that he doesn t know what he s doing when it comes to television as well Trying to make feature films out of skits that wore out their welcome the third time the were done on SNL makes no sense I personally like Tim Meadows and think that he would be great in the right movie It s a shame to see a talented guy wasted in a film that features unfunny after unfunny situation and caps it all with a dreadfully bad song and dance scene Any laughs here will be because the movie is so bad not because it s funny Oh well at least we can be thankful that there are many other tired SNL characters who will never have films done about them It s just too bad that this one made it to the big screen
1	A very good start I was a bit surprised to find the machinery not quite so advanced It should have been cruder to match we saw in the original series The cast is interesting although the Vulkan lady comes across as a little too human She needs to school on Spock who after all is the model for this race Too bad they couldn t have picked Jeri Ryan I like Ms Park the Korean lady The doctor has possibilities Haven t sorted out the other males except for the black guy He s a really likeable Bakula needs to find his niche In QL his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything He is of course big and strong enough for the heroics The heavies were OK although I didn t like their make up
1	This has to be one of the best movies to come out of HK in a long time i was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just looking at the title Loads of fantastic actors in this show and i was particularly impressed with Sam Lee s impossibly believable insane behavior and Edison s portrayal of a killer machine which totally reversed his normal idol image i would definitely recommend to those looking for a stylish and action packed movie However i must warn you this is also an equally depressing movie as every character in the movie is in some kind of dead end and trouble of their own and struggling to breathe Makes you think about what is life about really
1	This is why i so love this website I saw this film in the s on British television Over the years it is one i have wished i knew more about as it has stayed with me as one of the single most extraordinary things i have ever seen in my life With barely a few key words to remember it by i traced the film here and much information including the fact it s about to become an off Broadway musical Interestingly unlike the previous comment maker i do not remember finding this film sad or exploitative On the contrary the extraordinary relationship between the mother and daughter stuck in the mind as a testimony of great strength honour and dignity Ironic you may think considering the squalor of their lives Maybe it s because i live in Britain where fading grandeur has an established language in the lives of old money where squalor is often tolerated as evidence of good breeding I saw it as a rare and unique portrayal of enormous spirit deep and profound humour whose utterly fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave it poise and respect In a way i was sorry to see it being discussed as a cult Over the years as it faded in my mind it shone the brightest above all others as a one off brilliant outstanding televisual experience It was such a deeply private expose it seems odd to think of it becoming so public as to be a New York musical But perhaps somewhere the daughter will be amused by such an outcome It is she who will have the last laugh maybe They made a musical out of her before you Jackie O
0	The plot of EVENTY IVE involves college kids who play a cruel phone game that unexpectedly to them if not to fans of horror gets them in over their heads The STORY of EVENTY IVE on the other hand is that of a horror film that had a wee little bit of promise sadly outweighed by really bad writing What could have been a fun if somewhat silly old fashioned slasher tale is derailed early on by its filmmakers misguided belief that the audience would enjoy watching a bunch of loud whiny rich kids bitching at each other for most of the film s running time With the exception of a police detective played by Rutger Hauer in a minor role that is designed mainly to add the movie s only star power every character on screen is a different breed of young A hole Male and female black and white straight and gay an entire ensemble of shallow and shrill college kids carries the bulk of the film s narrative Worse since the tale deals with a PARTY game gone awry most of the time the scenes are completely filled with these little b ds Because of this there are few breaks for the viewer who must put up with the angry sniping of the thinly drawn protagonists Even though at least some of these people are supposedly friends invariably all characters interact in a very hostile manner long before any genuine conflict has actually arisen This leads to the worst possible result in a slasher film The audience intended to care about the leads instead not only cheers on the anonymous killer but wishes that he had arrived to start picking off the vacuous brats far earlier The real shame of this poor characterization is that otherwise EVENTY IVE actually DID have some potential Visually it s fine First time directors Brian Hooks and Deon Taylor know how to build a suspenseful mood They also manage to deliver on some competent if sparse moments of classic s style gore Surprisingly the production s cast is also fairly able It isn t that the actors aren t capable of expressing realistic human emotion it is simply that the screenplay co written by newcomer Vashon Nutt and director Hooks who fared much better behind the camera than with a keyboard is short of such moments EVENTY IVE can hardly be recommended as its familiar premise and few thrills can t outweigh the bad taste left behind by a story driven by a gaggle of unpleasant characters In this tepid whodunnit the real mystery is why anyone should care about a group of young folk who can t even manage to like each other
0	As usual i went to watch this movie for A R Rahman Otherwise the film is no good Rajni wanted to end his movie career with this film is it would be successful But fortunately or unfortunately the film was a failure After this he delivered a hit with Chandramukhi I Am eagerly waiting for his forth coming Shivaji I have read the other user s comment on Rajni I found it interesting as the user is from TN too Rajni is one actor who acts i think from his heart not from his mind He is not a method actor like Kamal Hasan I think we need to appreciate Rajni for his strong going at his age Any ways i need to fill lines for this comment so wish u good luck Rajni
1	Screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival under the title Come Undone April The cinematographer uses techniques that add to the storytelling Even with fall winter backgrounds for the present and spring summer for the flashbacks there can be some difficulty following the continuity Whether either lead is gay the actors well portray the budding relationship in real life terms from physical violence toward each other to their passionate lovemaking The story pulls you into the characters a bit slowly in the beginning But as the end approaches you really care about where these guys will be next summer You too will want a sequel to find out
1	I don t know why some guys from US Georgia or even from Bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they don t understand at all For those who did not watch this movie watch it Don t expect too much or don t put some frameworks just because this is Kosturica Watch the movie without prejudice try to understand the whole humor inside people of Serbia DID actually getting married while Bil Clinton bomb their villages gypsies in all Balkans are ALWAYS try to f ck you up in any way they can LOVE is always unexpected pure and colorful and Balkans are extremely creative For those who claims this is a bad movie I can see only that the American s sh t like Meet Dave Get Smart etc are much much worse than a pure frank Balkan humoristic love story movie as Promise me The comment should be useful and on second place should represent the personal view of the writer I think the movie is great and people watch it must give their respects to the director and story told inside It is simple but true It is brutal but gentle and makes you laugh to dead
0	This could have been interesting a Japan set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly installed American family but falls flat due to an over simplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and director The film suffers from the same problem I often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare i e the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that they re expected to Besides it doesn t deliver much in the scares department a giant crab attack is merely silly as generally the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way such as Susan George seducing diplomat friend of the family Doug McClure and Edward Albert force feeding his daughter a bowl of soup At one point an old monk turns up at the house to warn Albert of the danger if they remain there eventually he s called upon to exorcise the premises However history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which Albert and McClure possessed by the spirits of their Japanese predecessors engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death At the end of the day this emerges an innocuous time waster tolerable at just minutes but in no way essential viewing
1	I would not like to comment on how good the movie was or what were the flaws as I am not a professional film critic and I do not have enough knowledge of making movies What i do know is that making this kind of a movie in your very first shot is a big achievement and I would like to congratulate the Director for that However in some reviews that i have read critics have complained that Hiralal s relationship with his brothers was not highlighted and his siblings were completely erased from the story Now i would really like to raise a point here that as the name of the movie suggests it is not a movie about Hiralal s brothers it is a movie on the relationship of Mahatma Gandhi and his son Hiralal Gandhi nothing more nothing less If we start complaining about some characters being kept out of action in the movie it would be a bit unfair because these characters don t fit in the picture no matter how relevant they were in real life So i think it would be better if we stick to the main idea and stop satisfy a critic in ourselves Enjoy
1	This is a film i decided to go and see because I m a huge fan of adult animation I quite often find that when a film doesn t evolve around a famous actor or actress but rather a story or style it allows the film to be viewed as a piece of art rather than a showcase of the actors ability to differ his styles This film is certainly more about style than story While i found the story interesting a thriller that borrows story and atmosphere from films such as Blade Runner and many anime films it was a bit hard to follow at times and didn t feel like it all came together as well as it could have It definitely had a mixed sense of French Animation and Japanese Anime coming together Whether thats a good thing or not is up to the viewer Visually this film is a treat for the eyes and in that sense a work of art If you like adult animation or would like to see a film that is different from most films out at the moment I would recommend it All i can say is that i enjoyed the experience of the film but did come away slightly disappointed because it could have been better
0	All I could think of while watching this movie was B grade slop Many have spoken about it s redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events Yet really the techniques used as many have already mentioned were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole As far as the plot is concerned it was lacklustre unimaginative implausible and convoluted You can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as I would Granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action looks can only carry a film so far The action is poor and intermittent a few punches thrown here and there and a final gunfight towards the end Nothing really to write home about As others have said BAD movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are bad you revel in that fact This film however is a void It s nothing Furthermore if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then I would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way Requiem For A Dream Trainspotting Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Candy are just a few examples Though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like Go overall both serious and funny and Halfbaked On a final note the one possibly redeeming line in this movie delivered by Vinnie Jones was stolen from Lock Stock and Two Smokling Barrels To think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by Loaded is vile Overall I strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by NOT seeing this movie
0	urgh things a movie needs a good script a good plot and good casting i watched this movie expecting it to be hilariously terrible and was unfortunately disappointed when it was just plain terrible I lost the will to live halfway through The only thing which stopped me from stabbing my eyes out with a fork was Rose Byrne who was the reason for me watching it in the first place She did a good job as Rastus and her appearance hasn t changed much since she was it was a fantastic first effort in a movie the dog was also very good both did a great job with such awful material Sandra Bernhard i think was the biggest mistake of the movie she was completely miscast and i don t think she ever quite got the character I give the movie out of and thats only because of Rose
1	I can watch B B C and feel all the emotions I felt when I first saw it at aged well maybe all but one Certainly Miss K Novak has lost none of her silky allure in nearly half a century She was a thinking youth s Diana Dors All those thinking youths now collecting their pensions can briefly regain the heart clutching collar tightening blood pulsing ardour they felt when she gazed directly into their eyes back in the days when they were being told that they had never had it so good Now huddled up against the cold and fearful of being mugged by a Hoodie they scuttle home as fast as their arthritic knees can carry them from the Video Shop relatively happy in the certain knowledge that within the triple locked comparative safety of their fourth floor tower block flat they can regain just a small fragment of their lost youth and perhaps reflect that love truly is eternal This movie is Miss Novak s Golden Moment She seized it avidly and gave a performance of awesome voluptuousness combined with a hypnotic awareness of her own sex appeal and despite all this she convinces us that her character possesses a strange and beguiling innocence She completely dominates the amiable Mr J Stewart who seems resigned to handing her the movie Misses E Lanchester and H Gingold offer comic relief along with Mr E Kovacs whose peculiar talents are strictly proscribed Mr J Lemmon plays Miss Novak s brother He is a beatnik a species that disappeared as soon as it realised that its existence was being acknowledged by the mainstream Some of the more hardcore beats reinvented themselves as hippies a few years later Certainly they had become figures of fun by and Mr Lemmon does not appear overly concerned with restraint in portraying one But all else is mere frippery Miss Novak bathed in a particularly beautiful spectrum of Technicolor is the sole raison d etre for Bell Book and Candle It survives its reputation enhanced as the ultimate showcase for one of Hollywood s most beautiful women Loved by moviegoers ignored by critics Miss Novak will continue to captivate with that enigmatic smile all the time thinking old men have the strength to push the Play buttons on their DVDs One day probably after we are all gone she will be discovered by a new generation who will belatedly realise that it is quite possible for a woman to be fully dressed and sexually attractive at the same time
1	British comedies tend to fall into one of two main types the quiet introspective usually romantic study and the farcical social satire Settings characters and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories Butterflies is perhaps the epitom of the first type The scripts are very verbal including long interior monologues by the main character Ria a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life When she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman who makes his interest in her quite clear she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offered The acting and scripts are always on the money which makes one s reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one I was neither blown away by it nor turned off My mother on the other hand adored this show I think the degree to which one identifies with Ria s dilemma is the most important factor in determining one s reaction to Butterflies
1	The pioneering Technicolor Cinematography Winner of Special Technical Achievement Oscar is indeed enchanting Add an endless variety of glamorous costumes and a romantic cinema dream team like Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer and you ve got a rather pleasant picture Unfortunately the contrived plot as well as the over blown acting leave much to be desired Still there have not been any more breathtaking Technicolor films before this one and very few since then that can top this breathtaking visual experience of stunning colors Cinema fans who have enjoyed the glorious color cinematography in Robin Hood Jesse James and Gone With The Wind will not be disappointed in the fantastic work done here The Garden Of Allah will always be synonymous with brilliant color cinematography
0	With Knightly and O Tool as the leads this film had good possibilities and with McCallum as the bad guy after Knightly maybe some tension But they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants It was of course totally superficial beautiful English country and seaside or not The number one mistake was dumping Knightly so early on in the film when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part They missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low cost heartstring elements
0	I ll keep this short as I know I don t need to say much Alive is a strange little film that obviously appeals to some but I found it to be shockingly bland from almost the very beginning The film did very little to make any of the characters likable and the story at times became so convoluted that I completely lost interest As I said I know others enjoyed it but I found Kitamura s Alive to be anything but a lame extremely boring drama disguised as a thought provoking action sci fi flick I felt like I was suckered into watching this film based by its intriguing premise and uber exciting cover art My suggestion Pass it up for Kitamura s far more enjoyable freshman effort Versus or his riot Godzilla Final Wars And don t get me wrong I m always up for a good thinking man s film but this certainly wasn t it There was nary a moment that I actually cared about a single event taking place in this overly preachy dialogue heavy movie If you wanna talk about something talk about boring
0	For getting so many positive reviews this movie really disappointed me It is slow moving and long At times the story is not clear particularly in the evolving relationships among characters My advice Read the book it s a fabulous story which loses it s impact on screen
1	This is one of the best animated family films of all time Moreover virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli Specifically other great films include My Neighbor Totoro and Kikki s Delivery Service Spirited Away is quite good but a bit too creepy for typical family fare better for teenagers and adult The one thing that sets Laputa Castle in the Sky apart from other films by Miyazaki is that it is far more of a tension filled adventure ride Why is this film so good Because it s a complete package the animation is very well done and the story is truly engaging and compelling Most Japanese anime is imaginative but decidedly dark or cynical or violent and the animation itself is often jerky stylized and juvenile None of these problems plague Castle in the Sky It has imagination to burn and the characters are well drawn if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people None of those trench coat wearing posers There is plenty of adventure but not blood and gore The animation is smooth detailed and cinematic ally composed not a lot of flat shots The backgrounds are wonderful The voice acting in the dubbed English version is first rate particularly the two leads Pazo James Van der Beek and Sheeta Anna Paquin The sound engineering is great too Use your studio sound if you ve got it One aspect that I particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained Laputa was once inhabited and is now abandoned Why We never know We know as much as we need to know and then we just have to accept the rest which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized Indeed it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters who are for the most part one dimensional stock characters e g gruff general silly sidekick kooky old miner etc Highly recommended for people aged to
0	fulci experiments with sci fi and fails usually in his non horror films we still get sum great gore but not here Sum very funny scenes like when the prisinors are forced to hold onto a bar for minutes and if they drop they are electecuted the guy falls and and has some kind of fit on the floor for about two minutes until his friends who were struggling to hold on anyway lift him off the floor The city is an obvious model but not a bad one and the end explosion is at best laughable And dont get me started on the terrible battle scenes
0	This movie was bad This movie was horrible The acting was bad The setting was unrealistic The story was absurd A comet that appears once in eons is set to appear one night Most of the world s population decided to watch this comet Then the next morning everyone but a select few of people has been turned to dust from the comet s radiation People s clothes are still intact there are plants which are still alive but the people were turned to dust No bones nothing Thats ridiculous How can radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact Even better the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters Their makeup would not have even looked frightening to a newborn child The Insane Clown Posse scare me more and they re supposed to look stupid Then there were the survivors People who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie dom and death How can steel block a comet s radiation that supposedly incinerates people in their tracks Equally insulting is the s horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie or the s hair rock which serves no purpose in the film and makes you want to shoot your television The stupidest part of the movie however are the characters it focuses on two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek Voyager These three characters were totally unrealistic Who would go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere There were four minute horror scenes in the entire movie and most of them were dreams In between these scenes is unsophisticated dialog which makes South Park seem intelligent The silence in between the elementary dialog was painful I could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of Cheetos Don t see this movie ever
1	Moonwalker is probably not the film to watch if you re not a Michael Jackson fan I m a big fan and enjoyed the majority of the film the ending wasn t fantastic but the first or so minutes were if you re a fan I personally believe the first minutes are re watchable many times over The dancing in each video is breathtaking the music fantastic to listen to and the dialogue entertaining It includes many of his finest videos from Bad and snippets from his earlier videos It also includes some live concert footage If you re a big fan of Michael Jackson this is a must if you re not a fan don t like Michael Jackson steer well clear
0	One could wish that an idea as good as the invisible man would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects but this is not the case The story the characters and finally the entire last minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad scientist flick from the early s There are some great moments mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets But alas soon we re back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but schematic There has been a great many remakes of old films or TV shows over the past years and some of them have their charms But it s becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol classics under the noses of eager madmen like Verhoeven who does have his moments is a very bad one It is obvious that the money is the key issue here the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough and as a result Hollow Man is seriously undermined with clich s sappy characters predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever However the one thing that actually impressed me beside the special effects was the swearing When making this kind of film modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them Therefore the language and sometimes the violence and sex is very toned down When the whole world blows up the good guys go Oh darn and Oh my God Hollow Man gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them I m not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear but it makes it more believable if SOMEONE actually swears I think we can thank Verhoeven for that
0	This was a movie about infidelity and revenge A twin with the twin connection senses that something is wrong with her sister This movie took forever to establish the plot A plot that has been done many times The acting was lousy for the most part Once the plot comes together the movie ends Laura and Ashley are twins that live with an abusive father The father seems to favor Ashley so Laura gets the blame for everything There is a promise made that the girls would never be apart but as they grow up their lives go in different directions Ashley gets a job in a diner where she meets Barry a married man Of course no good can come of this The fact that Barry had tinnitus was a poor excuse for a way to track him down I kept waiting for this movie to get better and for there to be some resolution somewhere but it never happened
0	I watched this on the tube last night The actor s involved first caught my attention The first scenes were attention getters Some funny some sad Good character development I felt that the latter third of the film diverged If it was not for the early part of the movie I would have stopped watching I kept watching wanting to how how it tied together Unfortunately I feel that it never happened I especially did not like the extend period that several of the character were talking yiddish Was that the other shoe Would I recommend No I think not As other reviewers mention much of the slang is dated s jive but it was not too distracting The ending totally turned me off
0	A very young Ginger Rogers trades quick quips and one liners with rival newspaper reporter Lyle Talbot in this murder mystery from Poverty Row film maker Allied Productions The movie opens with a wealthy businessman taking a header from the roof garden of a high rise apartment house or was it from a lover s apartment Rogers actually has two identities at the film s outset that of Miss Terry the dead victim s secretary along with her newspaper byline of Pat Morgan Mistakenly phoning her story directly to Ted Rand Talbot instead of her paper s rewrite desk she gets fired for her efforts when her boss learns he s been out scooped Here s a puzzle it s revealed during Police Inspector Russell s Purnell Pratt investigation of Harker s death that Terry Morgan had been employed as his secretary for three weeks Why exactly was that After the fact it would make sense that she was there for a newspaper story but before Clues are dropped regarding Harker s association with a known mobster conveniently living in the same apartment building but again that association isn t relevant until it s all linked up to janitor Peterson Harvey Clark And who s making up all the calling cards with the serpent effecting a HSSS with the words You will hear it cut and pasted beneath Apparently the hissing sound of a snake was the sound made by the apartment house s radiator system which Peterson used to transmit a poisonous gas into the rooms of potential victims such as Mrs Coby in the apartment below Harker But in answer to a question posed to Inspector Russell about Mrs Coby s death he replied apparently to the cause of strangulation It s these rather conflicting plot points that made the movie somewhat unsatisfying for me The revelation of janitor Peterson as the bad guy of this piece comes under somewhat gruesome circumstances as we see him stuff the unconscious body of Miss Morgan in the building s incinerator furnace However and score another point against continuity we see Miss Morgan in a huge basement room as Peterson ignites the furnace she made her getaway but how And still pretty as a picture And who gets to make the collar off screen if none other than milquetoast police assistant Wilfred Arthur Hoyt who in an opening scene fell over his own feet entering a room Sorry but for all those reviewers who found A Shriek in the Night to be a satisfying whodunit I feel that any Charlie Chan film of the same era is a veritable The Usual Suspects by comparison If you need a reason to see the film it would be Ginger Rogers but be advised she doesn t dance
1	I think it was Ebert who gave Stella four out of four stars but other than his I have never read a positive review of this sadly misunderstood drama about class divisions love and sacrifice three themes most great romantic stories or films have in common Here the major theme is class division Stella is a story from depression era America That said it was translated to the screen then in such a memorable fashion that this remake if you ask a Stanwyck fan or two was not exactly appreciated Fans of the original never gave it a chance Furthermore this version of Stella was made in the s not exactly a time of great financial trouble in America as the depression was Now is the time to remove the rosy coloured glasses in the midst of a new era of recession and poverty in America and see that this powerful story still rings true is as timely and relevant as ever in its updated format Yes class divide is the major theme here Stella is among the working poor single with big dreams but little hope of realizing those dreams She works in a bar doesn t have much money lives in a crummy apartment You get the drift In the morning she doesn t really want to get out of bed On her wall pictures of movie stars she idolizes A man sees her dance at the bar He s wealthy educated from one of those upper class families that has nothing in common with Stella s His major concern is what ivy league college to attend her s is how to pay the rent how to be happy They have an affair They like each other Stella ends up pregnant Stella tells the guy the news His response How about an abortion She replies I just wanted a room full of balloons He supplies the balloons and the proposal but she sees his heart is not in it and has too much pride to accept She sends him packing Her daughter is eventually torn between the two lifestyles the love she has for her mom and the advantages and happiness and love held out to her by her wealthy father Stella alone and unloved and not wanting her daughter to become as unhappy as her someday makes the ultimate sacrifice She gives up the only love and happiness she has ever known to ensure the happiness of her daughter and perhaps live vicariously and with hope knowing that at least her daughter found something to live for Now for the movie Everything is right about it Beautiful score artful cinematography great set design contrast between the two lifestyles the messy apt and the decorated mansions wonderful and heartfelt performances by the whole cast with Bette Midler in particular Oscar worthy This is a film which is much more significant and well made than you ve been led to believe
0	I caught this movie at a small screening held by members of my college s gaming club We were forewarned that this would be the reefer madness of gaming and this movie more than delivered Tom Hanks plays Robbie a young man re starting his college career after resting for a semester What we the viewer find out as the movie progresses is that Robbie was hopelessly addicted to a role playing game called Mazes and Monsters a game that he gets re acquainted with after a gaming group recruit him for a campaign This movie is laughable on many many levels One scene features the group gaming by candlelight which is probably the best way I can describe it While I m sure that this was meant to be cultish in some way as most gamers know it s horribly inaccurate Most role play sessions are done in well lit rooms usually over some chee tohs and a can of soda The acting while not Oscar caliber isn t gut wrenchingly awful either This is one of Tom Hanks s first roles and Bosom Buddies and Bachelor Party were still a year or two over the horizon The supporting cast while not very memorable still hand forth decent performances Mainly the badness lies in the fact that it was a made for TV movie that shows the dangers of gaming Worth a view if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night
0	In the Comic Modesty is strong Alexandra Staden who plays Modesty Blaise looks more like an anorectic fashion model She does not either have the moral or personality that Modesty have in the comics Modesty would never give a woman an advice to show more skin to earn more money I cannot see any similarities with my comic books with Modesty and this movie Its like a Mission Impossible movie would be about Ethan Hunt locked in the detention room in high school talking with the janitor about when he went to junior high school and Hunt would have been played by DJ Qualls in Road Trip Soo if you are an Modesty fan do not see the movie you will just get angry If do not know much about the Modesty comics rent an other movie do not wast your time with this one I cannot understand how Quentin Tarantino can put his name on it I will ask for a refund at my DVD rent store tomorrow
1	WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS but not really keep reading Ahhh there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that I won t have room to list them all The opening credits set the playful scene with kitsch late s cartoon stills an enchanting Peres Prez Prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited but his grunts are unmistakable and no one else did them and with familiar cast names including Kathy Najimi a full year before she hit with Sister Acts plus Teri Hatcher from TV s Superman Every scene is imbued with shallow injustices flung at various actors actresses and producers in daytime TV Peeking behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an old fashioned delicious farce Robert Harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of MAD Magazine but feels like a gift to us in the audience Some of the cliched characters are a bit dim but everyone is drizzling with high jealousy especially against Celeste Talbert Sally Field who is the show s perennial award winning lead nicknamed America s Sweetheart The daytime Emmies like awards opening does introduce us to Celeste s show The Sun Also Sets Against all vain fears to the contrary Celeste wins again She is overjoyed because it s always such a genuine thrill Adam did you watch I won Well nguh The reason for Adam s absence soon becomes the justification for the entire plot and we re instantly off on a trip with Celeste s neuroses She cries screeches and wrings her hands though the rest of the movie while her dresser Tawnee Kathy Najimi constantly waddling after Celeste unseen through Celeste s fog of paranoia indulges a taste for Tammy Faye Baker for which Tawnee had been in fact specifically hired Rosie Schwartz Whoopi Goldberg has seen it all before She is the head writer of the show and she and Celeste have been excellent support networks to each other for years So when Celeste freaks Rosie offers to write her off the show for six months We ll just say that Maggie went to visit with the Dalai Lama But Celeste has doubts I thought that the Dalai Lama moved to LA Well then some other lama Fernando Lamas come on Such a skewering line must be rather affronting to still living beefcake actor Lorenzo Lamas son of aforementioned Fernando Lamas d Those who can remember the economics teacher Ben Stein in Ferris Bueller s Day Off as he deadeningly calls the roll Bueller Bueller Bueller will take secret pleasure from seeing him again as a nitwit writer Other well hidden member of the cast include Garry Marshall in real life Mr Happy Days and brother of Penny who gets paid million to make the command decisions on The Sun Also Sets he says he definitely likes peppy and cheap and Carrie Fisher as Betsy Faye Sharon who s a bitch Geoffrey Anderson Kevin Kline is the yummy with a spoon and he is by the way dinner theater actor now rescued from his Hell by David Seaton Barnes Robert Downey Jr and brought back to the same show he was canned from years earlier Of course this presents some logical challenges for the current scriptwriters because his character Rod Randall was supposed to have been decapitated all those years ago Somehow they work out the logical difficulties and Geoffrey Anderson steps off the choo choo Celeste can now only get worse and her trick of going across the Washington bridge no longer helps First her hands shake as she tries to put on mascara but she soon degenerates into a stalker Unfortunately she cannot get rid of Geoffrey Anderson so easily Geoffrey s been promised development of his one man play about Hamlet and he means to hold the producer to that promise I m not going back to Florida no how argues Geoffrey You try playing Willie Loman in front of a bunch of old farts eating meatloaf And indeed seeing Geoffrey s dinner theater lifestyle amongst all the hocking and accidents is hilarious Back in Florida in his Willie Loman fat suit in his room Geoffrey Anderson used to chafe at being called to stage as Mr Loman He was forced to splat whatever cockroaches crawled across his TV with a shoe and to use pliers instead of the broken analog channel changer Now he find himself as the yummy surgeon dating Laurie Craven the show s new ingenue so he s not leaving Beautiful Elizabeth Shue as Laurie rounds out the amazing ensemble cast who all do the fantastic job of those who know the stereotypes all too well But of course the course to true love never did run smoothly Montana Moorehead Cathy Moriarty is getting impatient waiting for her star to rise and is getting desperate for some publicity Will her plots finally succeed Will Celeste settle her nerves or will she kill Tawnee first Will the producer get Mr Fuzzy You ll just have to watch the second half of this utterly lovable farcically malicious riot And you ll really have to see to believe how the short sighted Geoffrey reads his lines without glasses live off the TelePrompter If you are not in stitches with stomach heaving laughter and tears pouring down your face feel free to demand your money back for the video rental Soapdish is an unmissable gem that you will need to see again and again because it s not often that a movie can deliver so amply with so many hilarious lines This is very well crafted humor almost all of it in the writing A draw with Blazing Saddles for uproarious

1	This is a quite slow paced movie slowly building the story of an ex stripper who begins a new family life with a complete stranger The viewer slowly feels that there s something wrong here I really loved this movie even though it leaves a slight bitter taste in the end It is clever well paced and very well acted Both Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner are deeply into their characters The little son pierrot is also very touching A thriller which does not seem like one A very unconventional movie very particular atmosphere throughout the whole movie though you might feel awkward a few times with a couple of scenes i ll give it a
0	I wish more movies were two hours long On the other hand I wish more American Civil War movies were MERELY two hours long Gone with the Wind Gettysburg that s about the length I ve come to expect although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted and even Gettysburg lasted as long as it did because things HAPPENED in the course of it By contrast Ang Lee s film is bloated and uneventful It actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours That wasn t a compliment It s really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation at the time it feels as though it will never end afterwards it seems to have taken no time at all The film gets off on the wrong foot as Lee plays his interminable credits OVER the opening footage bad mistake in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe The central two are Jake the son of German immigrants who are staunch supporters of Lincoln and Jack an equally staunch Southerner whose values Jake shares I had to re read that sentence to make sure I hadn t written Jack instead of Jake at some point or vice versa The two go off to become bushwhackers Southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they can t even be bothered to join the official Southern army which I presume they think is for sissies I m afraid Lee lost me right there It s easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes if we have some independent reason to like them or feel as if we know them in some way then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more Not so here We aren t properly introduced to Jake for at least an hour when we are it becomes clear he s a gormless pimple of a man who isn t a confederate by choice so much as by habit the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does whose psychology is purely immitative The people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way I found myself cheering whenever the Northern cavalry appeared on the screen I thought good kill the rebels end the damned war let me go home Aggravating this problem is the horrible horrible dialogue Everyone speaks in the same whining Southern accent I ve heard accents from all over the English speaking world and this is the worst of them all I don t care if Southerners really did talk like that it s simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours And believe me we do listen to it for the full two hours Lee s picture is a talky one largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical say everything three times folksy drawl It would help if they talked faster but not much Can t these people find a more efficient language in which to communicate In short the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech who don t bathe often enough to whom nothing of interest happens despite their being involved in a war Good points Jewel was nice to look at and so was the scenery But I have complaints even here The cinematography nicely framed looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake and as for Jewel we were teased with her body but never actually allowed to gaze upon it which I think is the least we were owed
0	I attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it for while it is suppose to have a good message the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of scripture An interpretation in my opinion will mislead a lot of people In addition I am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable Never before had I wished for a negative score to rate a movie So if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority then by all means get this film This comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi because the title will deceive a lot of people as well This was an unfortunate film because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered The film s only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the Time Machine probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future
1	I didn t expect much from this but I have to admit I was rolling on the ground laughing a few times during this film If you are not grossly offended in the first ten minutes this might be a film for you Ditto if you are the type that would enjoy watching Amanda Peet shuffling cards for an hour and a half It s certainly not a momentous work of comedy but given the low budget indy genesis this is masterful To level the playing field for comparison imagine all of the studio films with their budgets slashed by a factor of or so and see what you get Kudos to Peter Cohen and his network for seeing this through I look forward to his next effort
1	Waterdance explores a wide variety of aspects of the life of the spinally injured artfully From the petty torments of faulty fluorescent lights flashing overhead to sexuality masculinity and depression the experience of disability is laid open The diversity of the central characters themselves underscores the complexity of the material examined Joel the writer Raymond the black man with a murky past and Bloss the racist biker At first these men are united by nothing other than the nature of their injuries but retain their competitive spirit Over time shared experience both good and bad brings them together as friends to support one another Most obvious of the transformations is that experienced by Joel who initially distances himself from his fellow patients with sunglasses headphones and curtains As he comes to accept the changes that disablement has made to his life Joel discards these props and begins to involve himself in the struggles of the men with whom he shares the ward The dance referred to in the title is a reference to this daily struggle to keep one s head above water to give up the dance is to reject life Waterdance is a moving and powerful film on many levels and I do not hesitate to recommend it
0	The Matrix was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its Twilight Zone ish manner The general rule applies here and this sequel doesn t match up to its predecessor Worse than that it doesn t even compare with it Reloaded explodes onto the screen in the most un professional fashion In the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as Trinity is shot in a dream Immediately after that the film nose dives After a disastrous first minutes it gradually gains momentum when they enter the Matrix and the Agent Smith battle takes place But it loses itself all speed when it reaches the minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big groan worthy twist at the end Worst of all is the overlong Zion Rave scene Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot but it s also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music The bullet time aspect of The Matrix was a good addition but in Reloaded they overuse to make it seem boring In the first one there were interesting plot turns but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting The movie is basically just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realising just how empty it really is It works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better It appears that The Matrix franchise has quickly descended into the special effects drenched misfire that other franchises such as the Star Wars saga have The acting standard is poor for the most part The best character of course goes to Hugo Weaving s Agent Smith the only one to be slightly interesting Keanu Reeves is the definitive Neo but in all the special effects there is little room to make much of an impact Academy Award Nominee Laurence Fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue Carrie Ann Moss part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress A poor thrown together movie The Matrix Reloaded is a disappointment Those who didn t like the first one are unlikely to flock to it This one s for die hard fans only Even in the movie s own sub genre of special effect bonanzas Minority Report The Matrix etc this is still rather poor My IMDb rating
0	Scarecrow is set in the small American town of Emerald Grove where high school student Lester Dwervick Tim Young is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers fellow students alike The poor kid suffers daily humiliation bullying teasing general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of his peers Unfortunately he doesn t find much support at home since his mom is a slut after Lester annoys one of her blokes he chases him into a corn field strangles the poor kid However something magical happens no the film doesn t suddenly become good Lester s spirit gets transfered into the corn fields scarecrow which he then uses as a body to gain revenge on those who tormented him made his life hell Co written co produced directed by Emmanuel Itier who according to the IMDb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called Mr Duforq although I don t remember any character of this name I suppose anyone who ends up looking at the IMDb pages for Scarecrow will probably already be aware of it s terrible reputation I have to say it pretty much well deserved since it s terrible The script by Itier Bill Cunningham Jason White uses the often told story of one of life s losers who gets picked upon tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick We ve seen it all before we ve seen killer scarecrows before we ve seen faceless teens being killed off one by one before we ve seen one of life s losers get his revenge before we ve seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before we ve seen incompetent small town Sheriff s make matters even worse before The only real question to answer about Scarecrow is whether it s any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level The answer is a resounding no to be honest The film has terrible character s awful dialogue an inconsistent predictable story it has some cheesy one liners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a shovel he ask s can you dig it the so called twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame The film moves along at a reasonable pace but it isn t that exciting the kills are forgettable You know I m still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed killed with a stick of corn Director Itier doesn t do a particularly good job here the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means there s never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off Also I m not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these back flips somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in The Matrix or some Japanese kung fu flick To give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good he looks pretty cool but he is given little to do except spout bad one liners twirl around a bit Don t you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring I know he s a killer scarecrow but I still say he would have been bored just hanging around on a wooden stick all day There s no nudity the gore isn t anything to write home about there s a decapitation someones face is burnt someone is killed with a stick of corn someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat some sickles are stuck in people s heads someone has their heart ripped out someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouth With a supposed budget of about this was apparently shot in days well at least they didn t waste any time on unimportant things like story character development Technically this is pretty much point shoot hope for the best stuff If you look at the guy on the floor who has just had his heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing The acting sucks the guy who played Lester s mum s bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig fake moustache ever because he played two roles in the film the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous don t get me started on his accent Scarecrow has a few fun moments the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special make up effects but as a whole the film is poorly made badly acted silly too predictable very cheesy If you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out Scarecrows Not to be confused with the Gene Hackman Al Pacino film Scarecrow or the upcoming horror flick Scarecrow which is currently in production Scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels Scarecrow Slayer Scarecrow Gone Wild

1	This film was in one word amazing I have only seen it twice and have been hunting it everywhere A beautiful ensemble of older screen gems who still have that energy Judy Denchs ability to carry the whole film was amazing Her subtle chemistry with the knight in stolen armour was great
1	Everyone knows about this Zero Day event What I think this movie did that Elephant did not is that they made us see how these guys were They showed their life for about a year Throughout the movie we get to like them to laugh with them even though we totally know what they re gonna do And THAT gives me the chills Cause I felt guilty to be cheered by their comments and I just thought Cal was a sweet guy Even though I KNEW what was gonna happen you know Even at the end of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just deciding if they did it on the count of or I thought this was funny but still I was horrified to see their heads blown off Of course I was I got to like them They were wicked maybe but I felt like they were really normal guys that they didn t really realize it But I knew they were That s IMO the main force of this movie It makes us realize that our friends or relatives or anyone can be planning something crazy and that we won t even notice it This movie as good as it was made me feel bad And that s why I can t go to sleep right now There s still this little feeling in my stomach Butterflies
0	A really very bad movie with a very few good moments or qualities It starts off with pregnant Linda Blair who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks I m not sure She jumps through a window and wakes up and we see she is very pregnant The degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie She and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who I thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island Italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies On the island already are David Hasselhoff and his German speaking virgin girlfriend you know how Germans are said to love Hasselhoff He s taking photographs and she s translating an esoteric German book about witches I think Also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it and a real estate agent and a woman I thought was their daughter Evidently she was an architect and Linda Blair and the boy are the older couple s children I guess they all traveled to the island together but it really seemed like Linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them maybe they were filmed separately The hotel seems neat certainly from the exteriors but it isn t used to any great effect An old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in German sometimes which he eventually records on his Sesame Street tape recorder People start getting killed either in their dreams or sucked into hell or something Some of these gore scenes are OK but not enough to recommend the movie Though the copy I watched stated it is uncut on the box cover the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut Much of the scene is showing another character s reaction shots since we re not seeing anything ourselves The creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy looking wound of a mouth rapes someone He looked particularly nasty There s a laughably and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed I wish if a horror movie is going to cast her they would do something original with her role and let her leave Exorcist behind her except for the yearly horror conventions In the weird largely Italian tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to this is also AKA La Casa and Ghosthouse That is it is supposedly a sequel to Casa Ghosthouse La it s not that s also a better movie than this one La Casa and two were The Evil Dead and Evil Dead II again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa and much better than those There s also a Casa La AKA House which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake La Casa series and the series House House House II The Second Story The Horror Show AKA House III and House IV How s The Horror Show fit in there It doesn t really it claimed to be a sequel thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less or more confusion Oddly The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House and La Casa is also AKA Horror House Does your head hurt yet
0	Notorious for more than a quarter century and often banned it s obscurity was its greatest asset it seems Hey it s often better to be talked about rather than actually seen when you can t back the legend up with substance The film has played in Los Angeles a couple of times recently and is available on home video so that veil is slowly being lifted While there is still plenty to offend the masses it is more likely to bore them than arouse much real passion Except for a gratuitous and protracted XXX sex scene between a pair of horses Nature Documentary anyone there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama Once the sex and nudity begins it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation a looooooooong flashback to an alleged beauty and the beast encounter and a naked woman running around the mansion nobody even her supposedly protective Aunt seems to even think of putting some clothes on her On video I guess you can fast forward thru the banality but it s not really worth the effort The nudity doesn t go beyond what is seen in something much more substantive such as Bertolucci s THE DREAMERS Try as one might to find some moral or symbolism in the carnality I doubt it s worthy of anyone s effort Unfortunately for LA BETE now that you can more easily see the film the notoriety of something once forbidden has been lifted And this beast has been tamed
1	I came across this film by accident when listing all the films I wanted my sister to record for me whilst I was on holiday and I am so glad that I included this one It deals with issues that most directors shy away from my only problem with this film is that it was made for TV so I couldn t buy a copy for my friend It s a touching story about how people with eating disorders don t necessarily shy away from everyone and how many actually have dieting buddies It brought to my attention that although bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight it has more serious consequences on their health that many people are ignorant of
0	Preposterous sequel stretches credibility to a great degree as diabolical sociopath Stanley Kaldwell returns this time infiltrating the movie production of the novel he wrote for the garden drownings assuming the identity of a second unit director he murdered Film pokes gleeful fun at Hollywood with a tongue in cheek script taking shots at tyrannical directors who sleep with their actresses looking for a way up the ladder and dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight Brian Krause who I thought was dreadful overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced portrays the loud temperamental director who doesn t like the fact that his second unit director and screenplay writer Alison played by Dahlia Salem seem to be taking over the production Andrew Moxham is Paul Parsons who is the brother of a victim from the first film The film s dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it s worth Nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty with Stanley as clever as ever using his brains to commandeer a film production killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work letting no one stand in his way that is until Alison realizes who Stanley really is Alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject what motivated Stanley to kill why would he do such a thing and what led such a man down this dark path The humor of Alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller Of course you get the inevitable showdown between Alison and Stanley with a really ridiculous unbelievable conclusion regarding the killer s fate quite a hard pill to swallow Unlike the first film which was photographed with sophisticated polish director Po Chih Leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not needed such as shooting an all kinds of weird angles slow motion in a sepia color and several instances which are captured on video and rather annoy instead of impress This sequel to me just wasn t on target as much as the original with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious
0	If you want to watch a film that is oddly shot oddly lit weird stories of these men and one woman who enjoy beating the crap out of each other if you want to enjoy a story that goes nowhere of these two guys one a boxer and the other a gay man then you should watch this film After watching this film I almost felt as badly bruised up and cut up like the director of the film himself beat the hell out of me This is a movie where one is not meant to watch for plot or for great acting this is a film to gawk at in horror and wonder A lot like watching an airplane crash or a train wreck If you want to watch a great movie a good movie a B movie or even a mediocre movie this movie is not it A warning to all who watch this film please don t eat beforehand You might want to puke by the end of the film
0	I wonder who how and more importantly why the decision to call Richard Attenborough to direct the most singular sensation to hit Broadway in many many years He s an Academy Award winning director Yes he won for Ghandi you moron Jeremy Irons is an Academy winning actor do you want to see him play Rocky Balboa He has experience with musicals Really Oh what a lovely war have you forgotten To answer your question yes The film is a disappointment clear and simple Not an ounce of the live energy survived the heavy handedness of the proceedings Every character danced beautifully they were charming but their projection was theatrical I felt nothing But when I saw it on stage I felt everything The film should have been cast with stars unknown newcomers but stars with compelling unforgettable faces even the most invisible of the group Great actors who could dance beautifully Well Michael Douglas was in it True I forgot I m absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right Nothing like a Richard Attenborough Michael Douglas musical
0	The complaints are valid to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women I am okay with these night time soaps like Grey s Anatomy or Ugly Betty or West Wing because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end However when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men Taye Diggs Tim Daly and Chris Lowell into sexual tension and romps and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so called little hospital it seems like General Hospital or a female counterpart to Baywatch That was what men wanted and they had it so if this is what women want so be it but the idea that this is a high brow show or something men will watch is unrealistic
0	I also saw this amazingly bad piece of anime at the London Sci Fi Festival If you HAVE to watch this thing do so with a large audience preferably after a few beers you may then glean some enjoyment from it I found the dialogue hilarious lodged in my mind is the introduction of Cremator The animation is awful It is badly designed and badly executed It may have been a good idea for the producers to have hired at least one person who was not colour blind There s nothing else to say really this film is a failure on every level
1	This movie is really good The plot which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess what will happen next Such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a riddle Fighting scenes are very good There s a lot of different combat styles although one of styles was a bit unreal for me but it s only my opinion to watch and it s fascinating show The only thing which may be irritating is actors look A bit too effeminate at least for me Hong Kong was always good at kung fu movies especially in the s and s so Five Venoms or other its versions is great choice

0	THE DECOY is one of those independent productions made by obvious newcomers but it doesn t have all the usual flaws that sink most such films It has a definite story it has adequate acting the photography is very good the hero and the bad guy are both formidable men and the background music isn t overdone This is a DVD New Release so people will be looking here to see if it s worthwhile I don t know where all the s come from as there s no way this film is that good even if you re the filmmaker s mother The last film we saw at a theater was Warner s trashing of J K Rawlings much loved and excellent book Order of the Phoenix In comparing THE DECOY with PHOENIX consider that PHOENIX as made by Warners had no story certainly no acting was allowed by the director the photography was dreadful and the wall of sound overbearing musical score was just a mess I rated Phoenix a because the scale doesn t go any lower THE DECOY is times better in all regards If you have the opportunity give THE DECOY a chance Remember this isn t Decoy the Shootout or any such nonsense It s original If your expectations aren t overblown by the foolish scores here you might just enjoy the film on its own terms
0	Meaning if this movie got pitched scripted made released promoted as something halfway respectable given the constraints yeah I know Springer sex violence where is He Reminded me of porn movies I saw in college plot and dialogue wise shoulda just done something for the scurrilous porno market showed penetration and be done with it would have made more money the ultimate point of this exercise
0	This is probably the most boring worse and useless film I have seen last year The plot that was meant to have some philosophical aspects emerged to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix with plenty of clich s the lone wolf cop good looking psychologically disturbed sleeping with his gun nice hard worker and shy but good looking she scientist you add a cent plot and you have I Robot I was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of brands like FedEx Audi converse etc This movie stinks the commercialization and tend to be more a poor ad spot that unfortunately will not end after sec I wouldn t recommend this to my worse enemy if you have some spare time watch a good TV program instead or better read a nice book
0	Be warned This is crap that other crap won t even deign to be in company with because it s beneath them Okay got that out of the way let me say something more substantive I ve seen Ashes of Time a very long time ago thinking it was a fresh take on the material which is based on a highly revered wuxia tome of a novel due to the emerging reputation of the director Wong Kar Wai Well despite of all of that WKW hasn t succeeded at adapting the novel on screen according to a lot of wuxia fans mostly it is just shots of dripping water beads of sweats legs of horses running etc I couldn t sit through most of the movie Fast forward many years later when I wanted to give Mr Wong s movies another shot after hearing many praises especially from Cannes I was intrigued by his latest A friend told me to start w Chungking Express because it is his most accessible movies So wrong I was just p o that I got duped into wasting my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness Some professional reviewers mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern big city blah blah blah It s all fine if the director has a point of view with something to say as to why these things happen and tell it But no he merely shows what is Faye Wong s acting is very typical of Hong Kong s style garbled enunciation deer in the headlight wide eye expression try to be cute and girlish kind of acting the rest of the cast is equally uninspired I think the word Auteur is a euphemism for a director who tries something new and different which is to be applauded but not one who hasn t yet mastered the art of cinematic story telling which is what Mr Wong is for the last years
1	This is a true s movie Back then they made maybe times more movies than nowadays and that makes many of them quite interesting It was a cultural phenomenon that don t exist anymore Nowadays maybe the same kind of people that would have made cheap straight to video movies in the eighties are doing cheap porn Porn seems to sell Anyway this is above the medium trash movie level It has good fascinating story and it s quite well made I think In one scene you can even see the microphone swinging on the upper edge of the picture Of course there are also little cameos by Ozzy and Gene Simmons but they don t very much contribute to the film success although they are good in their small roles The monster heavy singer Sammi Curr looks really terrible especially when he s singing One of the scariest monsters I ve seen in horror flicks I may have nightmares of him next night Not recommended for intellectual movie lovers
0	Okay let me break it down for you guys IT S HORRIBLE If Roger Kumble did such a fancy job on the first Cruel Intentions then why did he do such a bad job on this I m sorry but this movie is stupid true it may have improved if its series was ever aired but lets be realistic this movie a crock A lot of bad acting NOTE The Shower scene Kissing Cousins What kind of line is that Slipery when wet Can we say DUH M This movie had effort I ll give you that but it was too stupid They even tried to make it funny by giving the house servants stupid accents which actually WASN T FUNNY It was pathetic Not to mention that they made everyone in the this one look Absolutely NOTHING like the original cast It s as if they made them look different on purpose or something I like watching it when I m really really really board which doesn t happen occasionally For those of you who did like it Okay what were you thinking Could you possibly choose this movie over the other one which had great acting and the fabulous Sarah Michelle Gellar A movie is gold if it has Sarah Michelle Gellar in it DUH But this movie doesn t no offense Amy Adams Oh yeah since when does Sebastain have a heart UGH
1	A Vow to Cherish is a wonderful movie It s based on a novel of the same title which was equally good though different from the film Really made you think about how you d respond if you were in the shoes of the characters Recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent spouse or family member in other words EVERYONE Though the production isn t quite Hollywood quality no big special effects still the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it And the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes ill You don t want to miss this
1	I didn t know the real events when I sat down to watch this just the fact that this was based upon a true story After the death of the kid s father Rhonda tries to help her daughter Desiree I did not know anyone actually named their offspring that cope with the loss This is really made for children as is often the case with family flicks with that said go ahead and get everyone together for a viewing though I d keep teenagers out of it unless you re sure they re gonna buy the concept but it doesn t downplay the sting that the death of a parent is and it doesn t really talk down to anyone The plot is sufficiently interesting and moves along well enough Acting varies with the excellent Burstyn outshining most of her fellow cast Mathis following that pretty well and Ferland and her peers with a few exceptions being the least convincing of the bunch and frankly they re irritating then again I m not really in the intended audience for this thing The editing and cinematography are standard and certainly not less than that While humor is limited to a handful of amusing lines or so the tone is not an unpleasant one There is an intense scene or two in this I recommend this to fans of these types of movies
0	This piece of crap since I can t call it a movie can be summed up by the following Stereotypical black criminal with black midget partner get in trouble Black Midget pretends to be a baby with a fully developed adult face body hair and genitalia Black midget is mistaken somehow by man and woman who happen to want a baby Black midget than goes on to commit acts of physical and sexual violence demean white people wherever he sees them and commit more crimes Happy EndingHonestly it could have been a good satire if it hadn t been directed so shallowly and had such talentless bastards star in it
1	Julie Waters is outstanding and Adrian Pasdar a revelation in a very warm very real and extraordinarily entertaining look at the complications gender dysphoria and transvestism cause in a young executive s life At the heart of this movie is the very real truth that you must accept yourself before you can hope for others to accept you
1	This is an amazing movie from Although the first hour isn t very interesting for the modern viewer the stylish vision of the year that comes afterwords makes up for it However don t plan on being able to understand all of the dialog the sound quality and accents it s American but s American make it difficult Basically the story is a sweeping year look at a fictional US town called Everytown It spans from when a war is on the horizon to when technology leaps forward and creates its own problems The first one hour is a bit slow although it s tough to tell what audiences back then would have thought The events suspense and visuals are pretty low key in today s terms However when it gets to the future it s just plain fun to watch The large sets and retro sci fi look of everything is hard to beat Unless you have great listening abilities this movie is hard to listen to I think I understood only of the dialog It could use closed captioning If you re a sci fi fan this is one of the genre s classics and is a must see well at least after the first hour For the average viewer wait until there s a closed caption version and then watch it if you re comfortable with movies of this time period
0	I had read many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novel so invariably my expectations were crushed But they were crushed more than should be expected The movie would have been a decent movie if I had not read the novel beforehand which perhaps ruined it for me In any event for some reason they changed the labor camp at Toulon to a ship full of galley slaves The scene at Bishop Myriel s was fine In fact other than the galleys things survived up until the dismissal of Fantine Because we do not want to have bad things happen to a good woman she does not cut her hair sell her teeth or become a prostitute The worst she does is run into the mayor s office and spit on his face Bamatabois is entirely eliminated Because having children out of wedlock should also not be talked about Tholomyes is Fantine s dead husband rather than an irresponsible dandy Valjean is able to fetch Cosette for Fantine before the Champmathieu affair so they reunite happily yet another change Then comes the convent which is a pretty difficult scene to screw up Thankfully it was saved After this three minutes of accuracy however the movie again begins to hurtle towards Classic Novel Butchering As Cosette and Valjean are riding through the park they come across Marius giving a speech at a meeting About prison reform When he comes to hand out fliers to Valjean and Cosette he says the one line in the movie that set me screaming at the TV set We aren t revolutionaries I could hear Victor Hugo thrashing in his grave OF COURSE THEY ARE REVOLUTIONARIES They want to revolt against the pseudo monarchy that is in place in favor of another republic you dumb screenwriters It s a historical FACT that there was an insurrection against the government in At one point Cosette goes to give Marius a donation from her father for the reform movement and meets Eponine Except not Eponine Or at least not the Eponine of the book This Eponine appears to be a well to do secretary girl working for the prison reformers who are working out of the Cafe Universal as opposed to the Cafe Musain Not to mention the audience is already made to dislike her thanks to her not period low cut tight fitting dress and her snooty mannerisms The prison reformers Lead by the most poorly cast Enjolras that I have EVER seen decide that handing out pamphlets isn t good enough anymore So they re going to build barricades I don t know about you but I have never heard of reform movements tearing up the streets and building barricades and attacking government troops About three hundred people it was not supposed to be so many start attacking the National Guard and building a bunch of barricades etc Eponine does die for Marius thankfully The rest of the movie is sort of accurate except that Javert s suicide again seems hard to understand thanks to his minuscule screen time and odd character interpretation The movie ends with Valjean watching Javert jump into the river This is again inaccurate because Valjean would never have let Javert drown He saved the man s life earlier why let him die now Then there s the whole skipping of Valjean s confession to Marius his deterioration and his redemption on his deathbed with Marius and Cosette by his side Overall I can blame the script mostly for the problems While I am glad Enjolras and Eponine were at least present in the film they were terribly misinterpreted as was the entire barricade scene The elimination of Fantine s suffering prevents us from feeling too much pity for her That Cosette knows Valjean s past from the start messes with the plot a good deal I did not even see Thenardier and Mme Thenardier only had a few seconds of screen time The same with Gavroche I did like Frederich March s interpretation of Valjean a lot however which was one of the redeeming features of the movie On the other hand Charles Laughton for all his great acting in other movies seems to have missed the mark with Javert The lip tremble the unnecessary shouting and his acting in general all just felt very wrong He also like many Javerts I have seen did not appear at all menacing something required of the character Again this film would probably feel much better if I had not read the book I would not recommend it to book purists though I would also say that the movie would have been a good adaptation for the time had not the infamously accurate French version come out the year before
1	This movie strikes me as one of the most successful attempts ever at coming up with plausible answers for some of the nagging questions that have cropped up in recent scholarship concerning the Passion suffering and death of Christ accounts in the New Testament What motivated Judas if money was not the issue What could bring the Sanhedrin to meet on a high holy day Why did Pilate waffle It is a movie for the serious thinking Christian fans of The Passion of the Christ will no doubt be disappointed by the lack of gory spectacle and arch characterization As for myself I find the portrait painted here of the willingness of ordinary people to so blithely sacrifice common decency when their own self interest is at stake far more realistic and deeply unsettling The disinterested just doing my job look on the face of the man who drives the first nail in Christ s wrist is as chilling as any moment in film The film makes no claim to authenticity but the settings and costuming invariably feel more right than many more highly acclaimed efforts It is a slow film but if you accept its self imposed limits it is after all The Death not the Life of Christ ultimately a very rewarding one
0	I actually prefer Robin Williams in his more serious roles e g Good Will Hunting The Fisher King The World According to Garp These are my favorite Robin Williams movies But Seize the Day although well acted is one of the worst movies I ve ever seen and certainly the worst Robin Williams movie even worse than Death to Smoochy Club Paradise and Alladin on Ice Every good story is going to have its ups and downs This movie however is one giant down I don t need a feel good Hollywood cheese fest but I ve got to have something other than minutes of complete and utter hopelessness This movie reminds me of Love Liza which is actually worse because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can fall The answer Who cares
0	Made one year before ILSA SHE WOLF OF THE SS BLACKSNAKE could have easily been called SUSAN SHE WOLF OF THE PLANTATION and it probably inspired the producers behind the Nazi sexploitation epics to go ahead with their more infamous films because the stories are identical a gorgeous horny head strong but stupid blonde woman degrades and kills many people under her control whom all hate her and want her dead Sounds familiar Director Russ Meyer and David Friedman the producer behind the ILSA flicks are good friends and they started their careers together So obviously there s a connection there Looking at BLACKSNAKE I can t help but think that Russ Meyer wanted to move on and do something else than his typical busty women epics because XXX movies were all the rage during the mid s and Russ Meyer films though filled with nudity and kinkiness and violence were never even close to real porn His films started to look positively quaint next to DEEP THROAT and other hard core porno blockbusters Meyer knew he couldn t compete with such films and BLACKSNAKE is sorta the end result of such a quandary in his career He obviously wanted to branch out into different uncharted territory But BLACKSNAKE bombed at the B O and Meyer quickly returned to making VIXEN type of films that even if they still weren t pornographic they were most definitely more over the top than any of his previous films It s no wonder BLACKSNAKE was a B O failure It s just terrible Trash o rama Jaw droppingly bad It s a quasi campy take on slavery if you can imagine that The end result is jarring One minute we re in typical Meyer territory exuberant playful and silly and then the next minute super serious meditation on slavery and violence Huh It just doesn t work The slavery racism aspect is woefully mishandled and veers this movie in the true exploitation category But BLACKSNAKE is not as sleazy as ILSA SHE WOLF OF THE SS and those kind of films so I imagine fans of the latter were disappointed by it which would explain the almost lack of interest in this movie from either exploitation fans or Russ Meyer fans Meyer blames the failure of BLACKSNAKE because and I quote It didn t have enough breasts in it Well I m sorry Russ but the film is just bad breast or no breasts But he s right though about the low breast quota Except for Anouska and the maid the film s cast is male Meyer replaces his usual bevy of buxom babes with throng of hunks with massive pecs in the form of anonymous black actors playing the slaves and the big David Darth Vader Prowse And with Anouska s right hand man around who is portrayed as a ruthless but clever gay man who enjoys the power he has over the men one can only wonder what Meyer was really trying to create here BLACKSNAKE stars David Warbeck who is lusted after by Anouska and her right hand man Poor David He looks totally befuddled by the whole experience He did seem to have fun making the movie but you can clearly see that at times he has no idea what s going on And then there s Anouska Hempel She s a beautiful woman for the s not the s With her makeup and hair she looks like a typical s Brit pin up babe than a turn of the century dominatrix And her wardrobe is hilarious At one time she actually unzips her leather boots I didn t know they had zippers in those days But the character she plays is in itself really degrading no pun intended She s nothing but a cipher to the object of lust and scorn of every men and that woman on the island For example one night when David and Anouska are getting it on her annoying slave driver walks in the room knocks David unconscious and tries to rape her groping her savagely The next day the slave driver is still working for Anouska and the two act as if nothing had happened It s totally ludicrous Under any circumstance had her character been a real person Anouska would have whipped the slave driver senseless and kicked his butt off the island Or even killed him But the fact that the woman keeps him on her plantation after he tried to rape her is stretching the flimsy story and characters credulity to the max Ridiculous details like this and the thoroughly startling blaxploitation angle makes BLACKSNAKE a strangely unpleasant but watchable movie Watchable in the train wreck variety I just couldn t help but watch the film for the utter baseless aspects of it all the excellent cinematography sorta makes it easier to watch So this being an exploitation film I guess it succeeded in doing what it was supposed to do But BLACKSNAKE is mainly for Russ Meyer completists
1	Cut is a full tilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do Most of the standard slasher cliches are there the old creepy house the woods the anonymous indestructible serial killer buckets of gore and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while they re having sex that s hardly a spoiler The set up is simplicity itself film school nerds set out to complete an unfinished slasher masterpiece unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast This also neatly okay messily disposes of Kylie Minogue in the first reel They are joined by one of the survivors of the original film played by Molly Ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines The rest of the cast fit their roles well especially the lovely Jessica Napier who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around her There are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace It also has an appropriate low budget look including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate Good soundtrack too If there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a send up of or a homage to the slasher genre Probably a bit of both
0	STAR RATING The Works Just Misses the Mark That Little Bit In Between Lagging Behind The Pits Some plutonium s gone missing and some very nasty people now have the means to develop a bomb capable of wholesale destruction so Josh McCord Chuck Norris and his cocky young prot g Deke Judson Mills a different actor from the previous film with the assistance of Josh s adopted daughter Que Jennifer Tung set out to stop them This was another film that dealt with terrorism a year after the events of Filmed in Norris himself even commented afterwards how eerily the plot line to the film resembled what happened in downtown New York that day so there d have been those that would have been in the mood for a film where Norris and his side kick kick some terrorist ass if nothing else Other than that it s as interchangeable as anything Norris has ever been in It makes you wonder what the original did to warrant a sequel in the first place and whether if this one could get made a President s Man might come out sometime soon If you ve seen one Norris film you ve really seen them all and there s really nothing new or unexpected that happens with this one but at least you know what you re getting and like I said it might have been just what some needed to let off some steam
1	What a good film Made Men is a great action movie with lots of twists and turns James Belushi is very good as an ex hood who has stolen million from the boss who has to fend of the gangsters hillbillies his wife and the local sheriff Timothy Dalton you wont be disappointed jump on board and enjoy the ride out of
0	This movie is not based on the bible It completely leaves Christ out of the movie They do not show the rapture or the second coming of Christ Let alone talk about it It does not quote from scriptures The end times are called the great tribulation The movie does not even show bad times The seven bowls seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a second news cast of the sea changing it s structure The anti Christ was killed years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended The only part they got correct was there was two prophets The did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of scriptures The worst part of it was I really wanted it to be a good movie I wanted to take unsaved people to it I feel that the movie is evil It is a counterfeit just like everything the devil does I just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind books The second problem with the movie is it was just bad Bad acting bad special effects bad plot and poor character development I have seen better episodes of Miami vice
1	Brian Yuzna is often frowned upon as a director for his trashy gore fests but the truth is that his films actually aren t bad at all The Re Animator sequels aren t as great as the original but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned Return of the Living Dead is the best of the series and Society isn t a world away from being a surrealist horror masterpiece This thriller certainly isn t a masterpiece but it shows Yuzna s eye for horror excellently and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging I m really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry didn t turn up until as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear it s running away from a tiger for the modern world Dentistry doesn t frighten me but surprisingly I would appear to be in the minority The plot follows perfectionist dentist Dr Feinstone He has a nice house a successful career and a beautiful wife pretty much everything most people want However his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wife s affair with the pool cleaner And his life isn t the only one as it s his patients who feel the full brunt of his anger When it comes to scaring the audience this movie really makes itself However credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme The fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that I m not squeamish about going to the dentist yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes The film follows the standard man going insane plot outline only with The Dentist you always get the impression that there s more to the film than what we re seeing It isn t very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level and while this won t be winning any awards the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot The acting while B class is actually quite impressive with Corbin Bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge I should thank Brian Yuzna for casting Ken Foree in the movie The Dawn of the Dead star doesn t get enough work and I really love seeing him in films The rest of the cast doesn t massively impress but all do their jobs well enough Overall The Dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies The gore scenes are sure to please horror fans and I don t hesitate to recommend this film
1	This film does a superb job of depicting the plight of an ALS Lou Gehrig s Disease sufferer The subject is done with compassion as well as humor Helena Bonham Carter is so convincing as a person with ALS that I found it hard to believe that she was only acting Kenneth Branagh a superb actor lives up to expectations as the quirky artist who misbehaves and is forced to provide companionship to Helena s character as part of his community service an alternative to prison time Watching the development of the relationship between these two is a treat from beginning to end Tha fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous performances One comes to care deeply for the two of them
0	This is a complete Hoax The movie clearly has been shot in north western Indian state of Rajasthan Look at the chase scene the vehicles are Indian the writing all over is Hindi language used in India The drive through is on typical Jaipur streets Also the palace is in Amer about miles from Jaipur Rajasthan The film makers in their about the film in DVD Bonus seem to make it sound that they risked their lives shooting in Kabul and around Almost all of their action scenes are shot in India The scene where they see a group singing around fire is so fake that they did not even think about changing it to Afgani folk song They just recorded the Rajasthani folk song How do I know it because I have traveled that area extensively They are just on the band wagon to make big on the issue I do challenge the film makers to deny it
1	This movie is a great attempt towards the revival of traditional Indian values which are being replaced by western ones Its a joint family story showing all the ethics every person should follow while communicating with every single relative around Shahid Kapoor gives a gr performance as a desi about to tie knot with Amrita Rao who is also very Desi and she also acts pretty well The genre of the movie is the same as HAHK and such movies deserve to be made in India for the revival of old traditional values The movies doesn t get as it isn t very good at music which counts a lot in every movie besides this it is flawless
1	This was a marvelously funny comedy with a great cast John Ritter and Katey Sagal were perfectly cast as the parents and the kids were great too Kaley Cuoco was a good choice to play Bridget who was sort of a toned down version of Kelly Bundy from Married with Children The writing and performances were both first rate Sadly John Ritter died during the series and it put a damper on things They had to scramble to change the show and bring in more cast members and it was obviously an uncomfortable situation but they handled it well James Garner was a good addition It could have lasted longer had Ritter lived I especially loved it when they brought in Ed O Neill in a guest spot That was great out of
1	The story of Ned Kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand and this film is no exception What ensures Ned Kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him During several battles he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce Indeed it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the Victorian police who noticed he hadn t plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged The story has been told in schools and histories of Australia for so long that some permutations of the story have ironically become boring The more the stories try to portray Kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster the less people pay attention Which is where this adaptation of Our Sunshine a novel about the Kelly legend excels Rather than attempting to portray a Ned Kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore the film quickly establishes him as a human being Indeed the reversal of the popular legend showing the corruption of the Victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd Here Ned Kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it No I am not making that up About the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the Irish versus English mentality of the battles While the Kelly gang were distinctly Irish Australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly a scene with some Chinese migrants highlights this Heath Ledger does an amazing job of impersonating Australia s most notorious outlaw It is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching Ledger and not Kelly himself Orlando Bloom has finally found a role in which he doesn t look completely lost without his bow and Geoffrey Rush s appearance as the leader of the police contingent at Glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state But it is Naomi Watts appearing as Julia Cook who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film Although the film basically implies that Cook was essentially the woman in Ned Kelly s life but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here Indeed a lot of the film s hundred and ten minutes feels more freeze dried than explorative Once the element of police corruption is established in fact the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushed Unfortunately most of the film s strengths are not capitalised upon Rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits Ditto for Watts and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins I can only conclude that another fifteen or even thirty minutes of footage might have fixed this But that leads to the other problem in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact One scene manages to do the speech making thing well but unfortunately it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while If one were to believe the impression that this film creates a matter of weeks even days passes between the time that Ned Kelly becomes a wanted man on the say so of one corrupt policeman and the infamous shootout at Glenrowan Annoyingly the trial and execution of Ned Kelly is not even depicted here simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll That said aside from some shaky camera work at times Ned Kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts and it has a good beginning For that reason I rated it a seven out of ten Other critics have not been so kind so if you re not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements and what could more more unusual than full body armour in a colonial shootout then you might be better off looking elsewhere Especially if you want a more factual account of Ned Kelly s life
0	I am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself but I just got back from this movie and felt I had to express my opinions Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE horror fan But what makes a horror movie I sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development I know they often lack in horror movies but Prom Night looked like it didn t even put forth ANY effort in that department Next we all love suspense That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises Yeah Prom Night had none of that Of course we like a terrifying killer Prom Night have that Nope it has a pretty boy with a cute lil knife And when all else fails at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore and the occasional nude scene Yeah well when you have a horror movie rated PG like Prom Night they leave that stuff out too So with all of these elements missing I ask does this still count as a horror movie Nope I d call it more of a comedy People in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when I saw Semi Pro that was supposed to actually be a comedy which also sucked but thats another story I think I am just going to have to give up on new horror All the good horror movies of the good ol days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money The people I went to see it with didn t even know this was a remake Which made me mad I wonder what will happen when there s no more movies to remake Where will horror go next
0	BE WARNED This movie is such a mess It s a catastrophe Don t waste your time with this one I warned you The acting story dialogue music basically everything is so over the top it s absolutely annoying and ridiculous It made me want to throw up if the dialogue acting story wasn t doing it it s everyone being shot crooked You ll feel like you re watching a comedy The problem is the parts that are supposedly funny isn t even funny The acting story cinematography you can feel everything is just trying WAAAAY too hard but it never succeeds Practically every shot is canted but so what This movie just feels like a student film No wonder they shot this in HD because it would be a waste to spend more money to shoot this on film If you re easily amused or like poor acting writing editing directing full of clich s everything that s forced in your face oh and did I mention poor acting well actually it s not all the actor s fault it s the director then I guess you ll like this movie I had to watch this for a class I would have turned it off right away if I could If you still can t tell by now I HATED this movie It made me want to throw up and get my time back at least I didn t have to pay for this garbage Jeff Goldblum you know the guy from Jurassic Park Independence Day is in this movie but he sure went downhill from then accepting roles for movies like this catastrophe
1	Oh it s so cool to watch a Silent Classic once in while Director Vidor is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy at least for cameo as himself The story is about having success in life and the way it changes you Marion Davies plays a girl that leaves its friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger drama studio She becomes a big star and the consequences are she really alienates from the real world For a moment she even denies her poor past The cameos are simply hilarious certainly the scene where the main character Marion Davies sees Marion Davies in the studios and concludes she doesn t seem that special It s got to be one of the first movie in the movies here and for real freaks it s awesome to see the cameras and material from way back then A must see if you ask me
0	It looks like the brilliant team of Shonda Rhimes outsourced the writing of this one somewhere offshore maybe to the MediocreLand PP reminds me any one of the many tedious promising at first but predictable within season David Kelly flicks Picket Fences Ally McBeal and now Boston Legal The crazy cases they get are so outlandish they barely evoke sympathy or sadness And that s what actually makes good medical dramas tick dramatic situations you are afraid of This could be me sentiment They are not funny either The actors are quite good but the plot lines are dead and cannot be brought back to live I m a therapist and let me tell you Amy Brennan plays the most unbelievably incompetent unethical untrained therapist Whoever writes her stuff flunked the ethics and the transference counter transference courses in Stanford Somebody should give them a Code of Ethics to read the episode with the nose bleeding wife and the therapist s involvement in it No therapists are that bad Women yearning for men who have moved on had been done to death we ve all graduated Sex and the City Addison in her youthful aggression towards the guy she likes very age inappropriate looks so unnatural on a woman over and this otherwise talented actress doesn t believe it herself and doesn t deliver it very well The only successful palatable developments are Addison struggling with her decision to move to LA and the Voodoo Dr and his coping with widowhood This concept might work with a whole new writing team
1	The only reason I saw this movie was for Jimmy Fallon who I ve had a crush on since th grade which was his first year on SNL I am a die hard Yankees fan and I didn t find the movie painful until the last minutes when they begin showing clips of the ALCS games I had to cover my ears and make small noises so I wouldn t have to hear that which must not be heard but otherwise it was completely bearable I thought Jimmy played the role very well because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky and he is a nervous and quirky guy I know that it may not be a Academy Award winning stretch but the movie is just a light fun romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men to see Jimmy and Drew worked well together and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that stupid movie What I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead of him and thank goodness because Taxi could have killed it I think Fever Pitch will help him out a lot Everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies I imagine it must be difficult and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time Tom Hanks Russell Crowe etc you ll see that they started off in some flops Busom Buddies Australian soap operas Here s wishing Jimmy a successful career on screen I never wanted him to leave SNL but what can you do
0	Repetitive music annoying narration terrible cinematography effects Half of the plot seemed centered around shock value and the other half seemed to be focused on appeasing the type of crowd that would nag at people to start a fight One of the best scenes was in the deleted scenes section the one where she s in the principle s office with her mom I don t understand why they d cut that The movie seemed desperate to make a point about anything it could and Domino talking about sororities would have been a highlight of the movie Ridiculous camera work is reminiscent of MTV and completely not needed or helpful to a movie Speeding the film up just to jump past a lot of things and rotating the camera around something repeatedly got old the first time it was used It s like the directors are wanting to use up all this extra footage they didn t want to throw away Another movie with Jerry Springer in it That should ve told me not to watch it from the preview A popular movie for the in crowd
0	Joel Schumaker directs the script he co wrote and has a group of Georgetown grads confronted with adult life situations The story line is a scrambled mess but some scenes are actually good There is a lot of wasted talent and time here The cast is more impressive than the movie Featured are Demi Moore Rob Lowe Judd Nelson Andrew McCarthy Emilio Estevez Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham The most notable being McCarthy and Moore Lowe is quite obnoxious Coming of age is not so damn easy
1	My favorite movie genre is the western it s really the only movie genre that is of American origin And despite Sergio Leone no one does them quite like Americans Right at the top of my list of ten favorites westerns is Winchester It was the first pairing and only black and white film of the partnership of director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart It was also a landmark film in which Stewart opted for a percentage of the profits instead of a straight salary from Universal Many such deals followed for players making them as rich as the moguls who employed them Anthony Mann up to this point had done mostly B pictures noir type stuff with no real budgets Just before Winchester Mann had done a fine western with Robert Taylor Devil s Doorway that never gets enough praise I m sure James Stewart must have seen it and decided Mann was the person he decided to partner with In this film Mann also developed a mini stock company the way John Ford was legendary for Besides Stewart others in the cast like Millard Mitchell Steve Brodie Dan Duryea John McIntire Jay C Flippen and Rock Hudson would appear in future Mann films It s a simple plot James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Dutch Henry Brown and killing him Why I won t say but up to this point we had never seen such cold fury out of James Stewart on screen Anthony Mann reached into Jimmy Stewart s soul and dragged out some demons all of us are afraid we have The hate is aptly demonstrated in a great moment towards the beginning of the film After Stewart and sidekick Millard Mitchell are disarmed by Wyatt Earp played by Will Geer because guns aren t carried in Earp s Dodge City There s a shooting contest for a Winchester rifle in Dodge City and the betting favorite is Dutch Henry Brown played with menace by Stephen McNally Stewart Mitchell and Geer go into the saloon and Stewart and McNally spot each other at the same instant and reach to draw for weapons that aren t there Look at the closeups of Stewart and McNally they say more than pages of dialog Another character Stewart runs into in the film is Waco Johnny Dean played by Dan Duryea who almost steals the film This may have been Duryea s finest moment on screen He s a psychopathic outlaw killer who s deadly as a left handed draw even though he sports two six guns Another person Stewart meets is Shelley Winters who s fianc is goaded into a showdown by Duryea and killed Her best scenes are with Duryea who s taken a fancy to her She plays for time until she can safely get away from him Guess who she ultimately winds up with There are some wonderful performances in some small roles there ain t a sour note in the cast John McIntire as a shifty Indian trader Jay C Flippen as the grizzled army sergeant and Rock Hudson got his first real notice as a young Indian chief Even John Alexander best known as Theodore Roosevelt in Arsenic and Old Lace has a brief but impressive role as the owner of a trading post where both McNally and Stewart stop at different times Mann and Stewart did eight films together five of them westerns and were ready to do a sixth western Night Passage when they quarreled and Mann walked off the set The end of a beautiful partnership that produced some quality films
0	After watching this film I was left with a two very annoyances about this film why did they make Chen s character this McGuyver hit man and Lee s character such an incompetent idiot Chen s character s background is that he was raised in an underground Cambodian orphanage for blood thirsty fighter where they learn to brawl it out to the death like wild dogs This detail is pushed early on during a scene where he gets into a cab and as it starts to drive he shows how he is unfamiliar with a seat belt Soon after this scene he has a similar situation at a dim sum restaurant Not only is he uneducated he is starving This is not a reference to Chen s scrawny physique but to the two early scenes in the film where he is scarfing down food one of which being rice porridge off the floor of the lower deck on an old ship Si in the first ten minutes of the film it is established that Chen is malnutrition ed unmodernized and has only thing going for him his dog brawling fighting style of some sort Despite this situation Chen manages to out shoot every policeman even managing to ricochet a bullet off a metal pipe to hit a guy in a head whom was holding Chen s girlfriend hostage and has somehow attained a super human strength swings a lb block of concrete plastered on the end of a metal pipe to the head of the police chief AS he is getting shot in the chest by said chief Now Lee s character okay I get it he s depressed he s got some baggage but wow can he do anything right One moment they try to make him cool composed and ready to take care of business and the next moment he just got beat again First scene he runs into Chen and he manages to misses him from approx ft multiple times Toward the end of that scene Lee watches Chen as his close friend and coworker gets slowly stabbed in the neck with a long knife for a good full seconds while holding a gun to Chen face at a ft distance Even at the end of the movie Lee manages to get stabbed to death and fails once again And my biggest problem with this movie is that it is presented in a manner that film makers are trying to get the audience to sympathize with Chen s character and that he is just killing to survive That would be a lot easier if I didn t just watch Chen kill innocent people throughout the whole awful movie Of the numerous people he killed only two people had the intention of trying to kill him the police chief and Lee Others were just people who were eating boat owners taxi drivers and policemen trying to arrest him not kill Overall Chen s character is a just a cold blooded killer who kills for what he wants even if its just a free ride Did I mention he is carrying a wad of hundred dollar bills throughout most of the film My stars go to some of the interesting director camera work who got in some nice shots Bottomline One made for the nut hugging Chen fans For me Dog Bite This DVD
0	This film was more effective in persuading me of a Zionist conspiracy than a Muslim one And I m Jewish Anbody go to journalism school Read an editorial Freshman year rhetoric These alarmist assertions presented in a palatable way might prove persuasive But by offering no acknowledgment of possible opposing arguments nor viable or any at all solutions few sources and each of dubious origin makes the argument an ineffectual diatribe And thank goodness for that I wouldn t want anyone to leave the theatre BELIEVING any of this racist claptrap A good lesson for me and hopefully a cautionary tale for you to actually read about a film before seeing it
1	As it is generally known anthology films don t fare very well with American audiences I guess they prefer one standard plot line New York I Love You is the second phase of a series of anthology films dealing with cities the people who live love in them The first was Paris J Taime which I really enjoyed The film was made up of several segments each written and or directed by a different director most of which were French but there is a very funny segment directed by Joel Ethan Coen Like Paris this one is also an anthology directed by several different directors Fatih Akin Mira Nair Natalie Portman Shakher Kapur etc and also like Paris deals with New Yorkers and why they love the city they live in It features a top notch cast featuring the likes of Natalie Portman Shia LaBeouf Christina Ricci Orlando Bloom Ethan Hawki and also features such seasoned veterans as James Caan Cloris Leachman Eli Wallach and Julie Christie Some of the stories really fly and others don t although I suppose it will depend on individual tastes I won t ruin it for anybody else by revealing which ones worked for me which ones didn t Word is that the next entry in the series will be Shanghai China is Rome Italy Berlin Germany or Athens Greece out of the question Spoken mainly in English but does have bits of Yiddish Russian with English subtitles Rated R by the MPAA for strong language sexual content
0	It must be assumed that those who praised this film the greatest filmed opera ever didn t I read somewhere either don t care for opera don t care for Wagner or don t care about anything except their desire to appear Cultured Either as a representation of Wagner s swan song or as a movie this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster with a leaden reading of the score matched to a tricksy lugubrious realisation of the text It s questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera or for that matter a play especially one by Shakespeare is about should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio Syberberg very fashionably but without the smallest justification from Wagner s text decided that Parsifal is about bisexual integration so that the title character in the latter stages transmutes into a kind of beatnik babe though one who continues to sing high tenor few if any of the actors in the film are the singers and we get a double dose of Armin Jordan the conductor who is seen as the face but not heard as the voice of Amfortas and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of Batonzilla or Conductor Who Ate Monsalvat during the playing of the Good Friday music in which by the way the transcendant loveliness of nature is represented by a scattering of shopworn and flaccid crocuses stuck in ill laid turf an expedient which baffles me In the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts but I can t think why Syberberg couldn t splice in for Parsifal and Gurnemanz mountain pasture as lush as was provided for Julie Andrews in Sound of Music The sound is hard to endure the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual Someone in another review mentioned the Bayreuth recording and Knappertsbusch though his tempi are often very slow had what Jordan altogether lacks a sense of pulse a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music and after half a century the orchestral sound in that set in modern pressings is still superior to this film
0	I confess to have quite an uneasy feeling about ghosts movies and while I sometimes enjoy the genre when it comes to horror but when it comes to comedies they really need to be crazy to be funny Over Her Dead Body seems to take afterlife a little bit too seriously and fails in my opinion from almost any aspect I can think about The story is completely unbelievable of course and did not succeed to convince me either in the comic or in the sentimental register The choice of the principal actresses was awful While Paul Rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy the taste in ladies of his character seems to need serious improvement as Eva Longoria seems too aged sorry for him and Lake Bell seems too unattractive sorry again A romantic story without good enough reason for romance is due to failure from start Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were actually better but they had only supporting roles The rest is uninteresting and uninspired with flat cinematography and cheap gags borrowed from unsuccessful TV comedies Nothing really worth watching nothing to remember
0	The only reason to see this movie is for a brilliant performance by Thom Adcox Hernandez who is underused in the movie within the movie As usual Tom Villard is good too Otherwise it s c p The possesor doesn t even exist how does he magically change the letters on the theatre marquee to spell out The Possessor Lame
1	This Night Listener is better than people are generally saying It has weaknesses and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis no doubt but I think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this The whole thing feels like one of those fireside this happened to a friend of a friend of mine ghost stories One big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate Everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility and real life just sort of plods along no So there are no flashy endings or earth shattering revelations no showdown scenes Thank Heaven You have to get into the zone when watching this movie forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a conventionally good movie Williams isn t terrific but he easily meets the needs of the story plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic No One as he is the Everyman the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story Toni Collette s performance should be nominated for an Oscar even if she maybe shouldn t win it Give it a shot For quality and content alone The Night Listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days
0	Men In Black was a real disappointment for me While the actors did a pretty good job especially Smith there just isn t a cure for a poor script once in production The movie really had a sequel kind of feel playing off partial events of the first film The story was in a word bad at best It wasn t thought out well and seemed very choppy and incoherent at times In the first flick the MIB Organization had a kind of elite force feel You had a few special agents and it had a clandestine kind of feel to it In the sequel the MIB Organization has a JROTC Summer Camp vibe The movie wasn t terrible or anything it just lacked the coolness for lack of a better phrase of the first movie A lot of the same old humor was recycled from the first to the second and didn t really add any originality to the MIB Universe A perfect analogy would be Episode to the first films Was it decent Yeah Is it worthy of bearing it s title Not really
0	one may ask why the characters snarl yell and chew the scenery without any perceptible reason except someone wanted to make a movie in barcelona billie baldwin is that the right one is forgettable in the cop estranged husband loving father of cute little blond girl role the story seems to have been cut and pasted from the scenes thrown away from adventure films in the last three years ellen pompeo s lack of charisma is a black hole that seems to suck the energy out of every scene she is in her true acting range is displayed when she takes her blouse off as the movies careens from one limp chase scene to another unfortunately the directing rarely goes bad enough to be camp or a parody it is all just clich familiar in every respect the director cast his own daughter as the precocious brat probably because no respectable agent would have permitted a client to ruin a career by being in such a lame contrived and uninteresting movie the only heist here is the theft of the investor s money and the viewer s time
1	Rachel Griffiths writes and directs this award winning short film A heartwarming story about coping with grief and cherishing the memory of those we ve loved and lost Although only minutes long Griffiths manages to capture so much emotion and truth onto film in the short space of time Bud Tingwell gives a touching performance as Will a widower struggling to cope with his wife s death Will is confronted by the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness as he proceeds to take care of Ruth s pet cow Tulip The film displays the grief and responsibility one feels for those they have loved and lost Good cinematography great direction and superbly acted It will bring tears to all those who have lost a loved one and survived
1	Yokai Monsters Spook Warfare Yokai daisenso a movie about yokai or traditional Japanese monsters of folklore It is alternatively known as Big Monster War or as Ghosts on Parade The yokai of the first installment include the teapot freak kappa water imp a living brella a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic a woman with a second face on the back of her head a dwarf priest with an enormous gourd like wrist so on These sorts of whimsical monsters derive not only from fairy lore but from a type of summer entertainment of the Tokugawa Era comparable to today s Halloween haunted houses or the freak shows of yesteryear but with exclusively phony freaks Ghosts goldfish monsters dancing one headed umbrellas were trumped up to create chills during the hot summers The fatcheek woman such were recreated by tricks or illusions based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls if their design for the movie is a bit simple hoky this makes them all the more representative of what historically was recreated for summer chills These rather endearing monsters have to face off destroy an ancient Babylonian vampire demon who has come to Japan disguised himself as a samurai lord Despite that some of the Japanese apparitions are a bit goofy too many of the costumes scarsely more than masks without even moving lips as they speak it is all played very poker faced is very charming It has some beautiful cinematography much as would be provided in a CGI film of the same decade Viewed in the right mood or with the right friends it is exciting moving touching Yoshiyuki Kuroda also directed the famed Lone Wolf Cub White Heaven Hell and was the special FX director for the excellent Daimajin trilogy The Yokai Monsters series is not the equal of Majin at its best but the Yokai are nevertheless great fun The first miike movie which is the most child oriented of his family films with the GOZU IZOO consecutively more serious though none too severe for young viewers
1	I LOVED this flick when it came out in the s and still do I still quote classic lines like say it again and you said you d rip my balls off sir Ron Leibman was hot and very funny Although it was underrated and disowned by MAD I have to say that this little gem will always be a treasure of mine and a movie that I would take with me if sent to a deserted island I only wish that someone would release the DVD because my VHS tape is about worn out If you like cheesed out comedy this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic It is military humor at it s best and worse Rent it if you can t own it
1	this short film trailer is basically about Superman and Batman working together and forming an uneasy alliance obviously the two characters have vastly differing views on how to deal with crime and what constitutes punishment it s a lot of fun to see these two iconic characters try to get along i won t go int to the storyline here but i will get into the acting which is terrific everyone is well cast the two actors playing Superman and Batman are well suited to their characters the same filmmakers that made Batman Dead End and Grayson also made this short film of the three i probably liked this one the least but i still thought it was well done for me World s finest is a
0	I watched this movie really late last night and usually if it s late then I m pretty forgiving of movies Although I tried I just could not stand this movie at all it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on Although I know it s suppose to be a comedy but I didn t find it very funny It was also an especially unrealistic and jaded portrayal of rural life In case this is what any of you think country life is like it s definitely not I do have to agree that some of the guy cast members were cute but the french guy was really fake I do have to agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story but overall my recommendation is that no one over watch it it s just too annoying
1	Now this is what I d call a good horror With occult supernatural undertones this nice low budget French movie caught my attention from the very first scene This proves you don t need wild FX or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie The plot revolves around cellmates in a prison and each of these characters and their motives become gradually more interesting as the movie builds up tension to the finale Most of the action we see through the eyes of Carrere who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these other inmates I won t say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen There a few flaws though the FX are not that good but they re used effectively the plot leaves some mysteries open and things get very confusing towards the end but Malefique redeems itself by the time it s over I thought his was a very good movie
1	I have seen this movie when I was about years old which was years ago and I never forgot this movie I was deeply touched and moved by the brave little boy and the beautiful eagle And I just couldn t believe it when he turned into an eagle just when everyone in the theater thought he was going to die My sister was in the movie with me and I asked her recently if she remembered the movie we saw with the boy and the eagle and she said she remembered it like we saw it only yesterday So it isn t just me This movie is a MUST SEE You will never forget it just like my sister and me
1	Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors My parents and I watched together C eravamo tanto amati on a summer night we liked it but we didn t love it as we loved A special day I believe Ettore Scola is pretty underrated we often forget to remember him maybe because his latest films were disappointing And so yesterday night my mum and I sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece Writing direction cinematography score and production design were sober and accurate but the thing I liked the most was the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni They re both excellent actors and play the main roles of Antonietta and Gabriele Antonietta is an housewife married with a fanatic Fascist she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for the huge families Gabriele is simply an Anti Fascist They spend together a special day that special day of when Hitler came to Rome visiting Mussolini I don t want to spoil anymore about the plot go looking for this film
1	Reese Witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one She appears like a fresh scrubbed face tween slight and stringy but undeniably Reese I have always liked her as an actor and had no idea she started this young with her career go figure I actually gained some respect for Reese to know who she was so early on I say that because whenever I have watched her perform the characters thus far in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character quite nicely in fact Anyway my first film experience with Reese was the Little Red Riding Hood parody Reese did with Kiefer Sutherland somehow I assumed that was her first time up at bat Not so well done Reese
0	This is kind of a weird movie given that Santa Claus lives on a cloud in outer space and fights against Satan and his minions but it s still kinda fun It has some genuine laughs whether all of them were intentional is certainly debatable though This movie is not good but I can say I really enjoyed watching it I would recommend this movie over Santa Claus Conquers the Martians Santa Claus with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow or The Santa Clause with Tim Allen
0	I had a lot of hopes for this movie and so watched it with a lot of expectations basically because of Kamal Hassan He is an amazing actor who has marked his foot steps in the sands of time forever But this movie proved to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen After watching this the movie the brutality and violence in tenebra and clockwork orange looks far better The Protagonist Raghavan is a very daring police officer Who is assigned to a investigate brutal serial murders Raghavan efficiently finds the connecting thread in this case and is close to solve the murders and put the psycho killers two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students behind bars but they escape and again get into a killing spree Finally Raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent lives THese two psycho killers are the ones who are going to keep the audiences from going to the theaters The murders and sexual harassments and rapes are shown very explicitly which the movie could have survived without To even imagine that teenagers and kids are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds are certainly not pretty The director Gautham should realize that he also has some obligation to the society and his audience Certainly i am never going to the movies looking like Gautham s name on the production list
0	Baba Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life This is the movie which caused his downfall It was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors Rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred Soon after its release he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably Its a very bad movie with horrible acting bad quality makeup and pathetic screenplay Throughout the movie Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease I m one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba first day first show in theatre The audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission Sorry I ll not recommend this one to anyone
0	What kind of a documentary about a musician fails to include a single track by the artist himself Unlike Ray or countless other films about music artists half the fun in the theater or on the couch is reliving the great songs themselves Here all the tracks are covers put on by uninteresting characters and these renditions fail to capture Cohen s slow jazzy style More often the covers are badly sung folk versions Yuck The interviews are as much or more with other musicians and figures rather than with Cohen himself Only rarely does the film feature Cohen reading his own work never singing like letters poems etc The movie really didn t capture much about the artist s life story either or about his development through the years A huge disappointment for a big Cohen fan
0	Bad plot bad dialogue bad acting idiotic directing the annoying porn groove soundtrack that ran continually over the overacted script and a crappy copy of the VHS cannot be redeemed by consuming liquor Trust me because I stuck this turkey out to the end It was so pathetically bad all over that I had to figure it was a fourth rate spoof of Springtime for Hitler The girl who played Janis Joplin was the only faint spark of interest and that was only because she could sing better than the original If you want to watch something similar but a thousand times better then watch Beyond The Valley of The Dolls
0	Was this movie stupid Yup Did this movie depth Nope Character development Nope Plot twists Nope This was simply a movie about a highly fictionalized Springer show It shows the lengths that some people will go to get their mugs on TV Molly Hagan did a great job as Jaime Pressly s mom Jaime is well GORGEOUS This flick wasn t so much made to be a breakthrough movie rather it was intended to life in a trailer park I live in a trailer park and ours is nothing like the one in this movie where everyone sleeps with everyone else all the girls get pregnant by different guys and all the guys drive rusted out Ford pickups exaggeration of course but that s the picture everyone sees when you mention trailer park Some people over analyze movies case in point Star Trek freaks I watch movies purely for the entertainment value not to point out that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene read the Goofs bit about Connie s shirt Could it have been better Sure But it was funny as hell
0	The one reason I remember this is that it was shown the week after Nigel Kneale s brilliant QUATERMASS serial was broadcast The trailers made heavy emphasis that the main character had a mutilated arm which had me hoping he d be like Victor Caroon from THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT stalking the streets of London No such luck because THE RACING GAME is just a rather drab thriller with the gimmick of having a hero with a physical disability trying to get to the bottom of investigations of corrupt horse racing I suppose if you re a fan of Dick Francis you might enjoy it but setting it in the context of the late s when THE SWEENEY had just finished and THE PROFESSIONALS was still being produced there s something lacking about THE RACING GAME One trailer featured a car over taking another on a motor way if it d been a trailer for THE SWEENEY you d see Jack Regan over taking a car and beating a confession out of the slags who d done a blag while THE PROFESSIONALS would have over taken a car and blown away the terrorists inside I think that sums up what s wrong with this series
0	I won t mention any of the plot because although it would be highly predictable anyway the one notable plot twist is given away everywhere in the movie comments in the plot summary here and even in the synopsis on my Netflix envelope I might have enjoyed it more if I hadn t known that Maybe This film has a deceptively good cast most of whom did creditable acting with the rather limited material at hand including Donald Sutherland Lesley Ann Warren and Tia Carrere and Rosemary Dunsmore in smaller parts It was impossible to like William McNamara but that was clearly by design And there were a couple of quick nude scenes by the callipygian Lenore Zann But none of this brings the slightest recommendation from me Don t any of these fine actors actually read these scripts before signing on
0	As a Turkish man now living in Sweden I must confess I often watch Scandinavian movies Most if them I never understand I think actors from Scandinavia work best in Hollywood Last week I watched a film called The Polish Wedding together with a polish friend of mine and we both said it was the worst movie we ever watched Unfortunately I was wrong this movie House of Angels is even worse None of the actors can act absolutely not the female so called star Helen Bergstrom The plot is so silly nobody can believe it I think the whole thing is a mess from the start lots of bad acting except from Selldal and Wollter Ahmed Sellam
1	Care Bears Movie A New Generation isn t at all a bad movie In fact I like it very much Yes I admit the dialogue is corny and the story is a bit poorly told at times But Darkheart while very very dark is a convincing enough shape shifting villain and Hadley Kay did a superb job voicing him Speaking of the voice acting it was great nothing wrong with it whatsoever The animation is colourful and some of the visuals particularly at the beginning were breathtaking The songs and score are lovely especially Growing Up and Forever Young the latter has always been my personal favourite of the two The care bears who I do like are adorable and the human children are well done too And the ending is a real tearjerker All in all harmless kiddie fun Bethany Cox
0	This movie is one reason IMDB should allow a vote of The acting is awful even what some here have lauded the Carpathia character The script looks like it was written in haste In one scene the black preacher who was left behind when asked by Buck what dan in the computer graphic meant said Daniel CHAPTER He probably meant VERSE but the film makers missed this slip up Perhaps the worst part is that the film s eschatological position is Biblically unsound While many Christians have espoused the film s interpretation of end time events such interpretation in my opinion is faulty To understand these flaws read Christians Will Go Through The Tribulation by Jim McKeever and The Blessed Hope A Biblical Study of the Second Advent and the Rapture by George E Ladd
0	Repugnant Bronson thriller Unfortunately it s technically good and I gave it but it s so utterly vile that it would be inconceivable to call it entertainment Far more disturbing than a typical slasher film
0	Living in the Middle East in Israel I was excited when I bought my ticket for Syriana Having seen the trailer and being a thriller lover I expected to see first of all a fast moving breath catching movie which wisely dips in global policy making and the relation between oil power and corruption from a fresh angle Well I almost left the movie in the middle The pace was painfully slow almost all characters were stereotyped the intertwined editing made understanding the logic very difficult but as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review in the end you don t care Save your money save your time choose another movie Robi Chernitsky
1	year old Arnald Hillerman accidentally kills his older brother Eugene His feelings are arrested by the fact that his family can not interact with him or feel it is not the right thing to do His ONLY refuge is his grandfather who is the ONLY one who seems to have compassion on him The Realism will captivate true life movie lovers but will not satisfy those that desire action thrills
1	I m so glad I happened to see this video at the store I was looking for some happy movies and this one turned out to be a true gem I loved that the movie a love story of sorts wasn t about some beautiful twenty somethings rather it s a story of some beautiful sixty somethings who used used to be twenty somethings It s a good well written and wonderfully acted story with fabulous WWII band music thrown in as well It s also got a delightful surprise in it for Scottish castle lovers It left me smiling and ready to watch it again which I did a couple more times before I turned it in I highly recommend it
1	This is the kind of movie Hollywood needs to make more of No extravagant props no car chases no clever one liners Just people dealing with being people William Macy plays an unlikely hitman who works for his father Donald Sutherland Macy is the dutiful son Sutherland is the domineering father Son wants out of the business father won t let him Macy loves his own son played beautifully by David Dorfman The Ring He also starts to fall in love with Neve Campbell a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatrist s office It s an interesting juxtaposition of characters and the film follows the reluctant killer as he balances his own needs with those of his family There are many touching scenes especially between Macy and his little boy And as you d expect in a film with William Macy in it there s a bit of humor too Excellent job all around actors and director Nice to know they can still make a good film in Hollywood on a small budget
1	It is finally coming out The first season will be available March It is currently airing on ABC Family from pm eastern time Monday through Friday The last episode will air on December th at I missed it the first times around I wish I could buy the whole series right now Who does she pick I have to write lines in order to reply to the first comment What am I going to say La da da de de La da da de de nope only up to how do I get to almost almost awww now I need I missed counted this is only number Punky Brewster is pretty awesome too Almost to almost awwwwww
1	Superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious s exploitation hooray The pre credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we re dealing with a serious and harrowing drama but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we re up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles rough fist fights lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity Bo and Ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship Can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sister s naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes Well Bo does that to his sister and judging by her dubbed laughter she doesn t mind at all Sick dude Anyway as kids they fled from Russia with their parents but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy A friendly smuggler took custody over them however and even raised and trained Bo and Ingrid into expert smugglers When the actual plot lifts off years later they re facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable White Fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine Very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of White Fire but it sure is a lot of fun to watch Most of the time you have no clue who s beating up who or for what cause and I bet the actors understood even less but whatever The violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded The script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly and I won t reveal for what reason Bo needs a replacement for Ingrid and Fred Williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes Bo s principal opponent is an Italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film there s the obligatory we re falling in love montage and loads of other attractions My God what a brilliant experience The original French title translates itself as Life to Survive which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie None
0	There are pretty landscape shots Writers putting trite mouthings into actors mouths With lesser actors this show would be silly Art must uplift humanity or it s BS Not so because art of all those mentioned is also to stir humanity and express the dark side The lead character even says those who don t drink hide the shadow side Wrong he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one dimensional not expanding his horizons with something other than landscapes There wasn t a breathing organism in his work nor expression of his pain All the artist did was limit himself to dime a dozen landscapes The discussions between the characters was grade school trite stuff always giving the one character the upper hand the writer wanted I tried to like it after reading all the first wow comments on here I had to dig deep to see those i agreed with I figure the great comments were from those connected to the movie I was moved only once towards the end The kid was way too passive The scenery was nice and the music ridiculous Just my opinion but nowhere show for me
0	somewhere i d read that this film is supposed to be a comedy after seeing it i d call it anything but the point of this movie eludes me the dialogue is all extremely superficial and absurd many of the sets seemed to be afterthoughts and despite all the nudity and implied sexual content there s nothing erotic about this film all leaving me to wonder just what the heck this thing is about the title premise could have been the basis for a fun if politically incorrect comedy instead we re treated to cheap amateurish unfinished sketches and depravity and weirdness for its own sake if i want that i ll go buy a grace jones cd
1	When I heard about Hammerhead being released on DVD and finally found it at my local DVD store I thought well just another cheap monster movie from Nu Image Those guys around Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner produced cheap but very entertaining B Pictures in the past few months but also some very disappointing movies So I didn t expect much especially after having watched the rather disappointing Shark Zone just a few days before But Hammerhead turned out to be an excellent revival of the s monster movies We have a mad scientist a group of people in a dangerous situation screaming women and damsels in distress man eating plants and of course we have the creature a huge mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark Everything you need for an entertaining monster movie The only thing missing are graphic sex scenes and nudity which you expect in movies of this kind but since the movie was made for TV it s understandable why these scenes are missing And it doesn t matter anyway cause Hammerhead is action and horror entertainment at it s best There are two reasons why I gave it seven out of ten points though First of all the monster isn t seen very often and the showdown with the destruction of the creature is too fast and poorly done and secondly William Forsythe just isn t the right guy for the hero part and for falling in love with gorgeous Hunter Tylo Other than that I can highly recommend this movie for any monster movie fan out there Grab yourselves a cool drink and some popcorn watch this movie and have fun Jasper P Morgan
1	This was a great movie Even though there was only about people including myself there it was great My friend and I laughed a lot My mom even enjoyed it There was two middle aged women there and a mid year old there and they seemed to enjoy it I love the part where Corky and Ned are like both liking Nancy and stuff its cute lol And when she gets her roadster and Ned is there Yeah This was a great movie even thought people underestimated it lol Go See it i bet you ll enjoy it I really enjoyed it and so did my friend People were so tough on this movie and they hadn t even seen it I bet next time they will give the movie and actresses a chance They all did a great job in my opinion But if you have young kids its still appropriate I will probably take my year old niece to watch it too
1	Corean cinema can be quite surprising for an occidental audience because of the multiplicity of the tones and genres you can find in the same movie In a Coreen drama such as this Secret Sunshine you ll also find some comical parts thriller scenes and romantic times There s not only tragedy in life there s also tragic comedy says at one point of the movie the character interpreted by Song Kang ho summing up the mixture of the picture But don t get me wrong this heterogeneity of the genres the movie deals with adds veracity to the experience this rich movie offers to its spectators That doesn t mean that it lacks unity on the contrary it s rare to see such a dense and profound portrait of a woman in pain Shin ae who s in quest for a quiet life with her son in the native town of her late husband really gives by all the different faces of suffering she s going through unity to this movie It s realistic part is erased by the psychological descriptions of all the phases the poor mother is going through Denial lost anger faith pert of reality the movie fallows all the steps the character crosses and looks like a psychological catalog of all the suffering phases a woman can experience The only thing is to accept what may look like a conceptual experience the woman wears the mask of tragedy the man represents the comical interludes and to let the artifices of the movie touch you I must say that some parts of the movie really did move me especialy in the beginning particularly those concerning the unability of Chang Joan to truly help the one he loves but also that the accumulation of suffering emotionally tired me towards the end Nevertheless some cinematographic ideas are really breathtaking and surprising the scene where a body is discovered in a large shot is for instance amazing This kind of scenes makes Secret Sunshine the melo equivalent of The Host for horror movies or Memories of murder for thrillers These movies are indeed surprising most original aesthetically incredible and manage to give another dimension to the genres they deal with The only thing that Secret Sunshine forgets as The host forgot to be scary is to make its audience cry bad point for a melodrama but good point for a good film
1	This move actually had me jumping out of my chair in anticipation of what the actors were going to do The acting was the best Farrah should have gotten a Oscar for this she was fabulous James Russo was so good I hated him he was the villain and played it wonderful There aren t many movies that have riveted me as this one The cast was great Alfie looking shocked with those big eyes Farrah looking like a victim and you re lived her horror as she went through it Farrah made you feel like you were there and feeling the same anger she felt you wanted her to hurt him yet you also knew it was the wrong thing to do The movie had you on a roller coaster ride and you went up and down with each scene
1	A tour deforce OK the kid that plays Oliver is a bit toooooo sweet Starting with the great cinematography color costumes and most impressive performances this is a must see movie I have seen several adaptations of this great novel but this one stands above them all and its a musical to boot It is a masterful Fagan never leaving his character to do a song You never really know if you like him or not the same feeling I got in the book In other versions you hate him from start to finish Bill Sykes when you read the book hes a mean one and so he is in this movie Oliver Reed was masterful His wife directed this masterpiece I went and saw his last movie Gladiator based on his many fine performances not to see the headliners The music fits the times and the mood Who will buy this beautiful movie You Should
0	SPOILER ALERT Personally I don t understand why Pete did not help to save Williams life I mean that would be great to know why William was motivated or forced I think Secret Service members are every day people and there is a rumor the writer was a member of the Secret Service now he s motivations are clear well known But as a rental this film will not satisfy you cause the old but used twists the average acting these are just things in this film only for keep you wait the end Clark Johnson as the director of S W A T did a far better work like this time and I still wondering how the producers for example Michael Douglas left this film to theaters
1	I m glad that users as of this date who liked this movie are now coming forward I don t understand the people who didn t like this movie it seems like they were expecting a serious treatment C mon how the hell can you take the premise of a killer snowman seriously The filmmakers knew this was a silly premise and they didn t try to deny it The straight faced delivery of scenes actually makes it FUNNY Yes there are times where the low budget shows such as that explosion scene but I think an expensive look would have taken away from the fun of the movie So if you like B movies and the goofy premise appeals to you then you ll certainly like Jack Frost
1	I was absolutely mesmerised by this series from the moment Tom Long walked into shot the whole bad boy thing it was just addictive The story has you hooked what will happen next will Joey get the girl in the end after doing years in prison and all that time thinking about his lost love crossing paths with her again finding he has a son Although he is a violent bad guy you still want him to find happiness A truly captivating two parter please bring it out on video
0	Never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent Let s see FIRST they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white bread NEXT they encourage as many fundamentalist Christians as possible to purchase copies of the film so as to recoup its paltry production costs and pump up its advertising budget And FINALLY when the film hits the theaters get as many said Christians as possible to see it yet again bus them into the multiplexes if necessary NOT on the merits of the film itself but because a box office opening will be seen as some sort of profound spiritual victory But THAT of course won t be enough I imagine that any film critic with the audacity to give Left Behind anything short of a glowing review will be deemed anti Christian Of course this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign shouldn t surprise anyone It is after all good old fashioned Capitalism at work What DOES surprise me is how many people have been suckered into the whole Left Behind mindset As someone who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with some sense of reason and rationality it leaves me scratching my head It would appear that there are many MANY people who actually believe that sometime in the near future a Rapture is going to occur and that millions of people all over the Earth are going to simultaneously vanish INTO THIN AIR What kind of reality I wonder are these people living in Is this Rapture something they actually believe in or is it something they fervently WANT to believe in And when they reach the end of their lives and realize this Rapture has not occurred will they be disappointed and disillusioned Will there still be people years from now insisting that the Rapture is imminent In a way I almost wish that such an event would occur What an interesting day that would be What would be even more interesting is if the Apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion not in the anthropological sense the authors of the Left Behind series have portrayed but as more of a Stephen Spielberg production with boiling clouds trumpets angels descending out of the sky Moon turned to blood the whole nine yards Imagine coming to the realization that it was all coming true just as the evangelists had been warning for years and that there was something more awesome than just the cold hard physical reality we inhabit Wouldn t THAT be something Yet in the final analysis it s that cold hard physical reality that I will content myself with My life is not so meaningless that I need the fear of a Rapture and the End Times to make sense of it all nor do I need Heaven or Hell to bribe or scare me into behaving decently thank you very much
1	WWE was in need of a saviour as Wrestlemania rolled around The departure of Bret Hart and subsequent evaporation of the Hart Foundation had left the Vile D Generation X stable unchallenged in the WWE Their despicable leader Shawn Michaels had stolen the title from Hart thanks to the interference of Vince McMahon and with help from his cohorts Triple H and Chyna had systematically taken out anyone who challenged his supremacy But at the Royal Rumble a new contender had emerged Stone Cold Steve Austin Hated by McMahonagement Austin had DX worried So worried in fact that they d enlisted the help of The Baddest Man on the Planet Mike Tyson as a special enforcer Austin would have the odds firmly against him in his title match with Shawn Michaels But first there was an undercard to get through which kicked off with the Legion of Doom winning a forgettable team battle Royal to become NO contenders for the tag titles I d actually forgotten this match existed until I rewatched the PPV No very good and really highlighted the lack of depth in the tag division at that period in time Next match saw the Light Heavyweight title defended by Champion Taka Michonoku against Aguila The WWE had established the Light Heavyweight Title to compete with the strong Cruiserweight Division in WCW It was not successful and this was the only time the title was ever defended at Wrestlemania Short match going about five minutes and in fact too short for much to be achieved What little they did was exciting and this was a nice little match which saw Taka retaining his title OK our next match saw DX member Triple H defending the WWE European title which he d won in farcical fashion from Shawn Michaels on RAW in December and hadn t defended on PPV against Owen Hart the Sole Survivor Triple H got a big entrance with the DX band there to perform his theme song Chyna accompanied Triple H to ringside but was then handcuffed to WWE Commissioner Sgt Slaughter Triple H and Owen have a nice little match before Chyna interfered causing a low blow on Hart which leads to Triple H retaining the title Good match could have been great had it gone slightly longer But of course we wouldn t want to take time away from our next match which saw real life husband and wife Marc Mero and Sable defeat Goldust and Luna Vachon in the first mixed tag match at Wrestlemania in years And in all honesty it wasn t worth the wait While not terrible the match was in no way memorable either This was the nearing the end of Mero s only run in the WWE and the main purpose was to continue the disintegration of his relationship with Sable Next up we saw Ken Shamrock flip out and cost himself the Intercontinental Championship as he destroyed IC Champion The Rock but then refused to let go of his ankle lock submission hold resulting in the referee reversing his decision This was a short match but decent for what it was Next saw the first good match of the night as WWE Tag Team Champions the New Age Outlaws lost their titles to Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie in a fun dumpster match The decision was overturned the following night as Cactus and chainsaw had thrown the Outlaws into a dumpster backstage rather than the one being used in the match but this was still a fun match NOw it was time for the highly anticipated first ever meeting between Kane and his brother the Undertaker Kane had cost Undertaker the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble and then killed him when he helped Shawn Michaels lock Undertaker in a casket and set him on fire as revenge for the Undertaker burning down their parents house and leaving him horribly disfigured years before This was a decent match and told a nice story as the Underataker absorbed everything Kane could throw at him and then knocked him out with three tombstones to end the match This left only the main event which saw WWE Champion face Steve Austin with Mike Tyson as the guest enforcer Michaels had suffered a debilitating back injury in his match with the Undertaker at the Royal Rumble and was remarkable in this match despite his physical limitations Triple H and Chyna were banished to the back in the early going after interfering from the outside The match ended with Austin ducking an attempt at Sweet Chin Music and hitting the Stone Cold Stunner with the ref down TYson then came into the ring to count the three celebrating the win with Austin and then knocking out Michaels after the match It turned out Tyson and Austin were together and the cat had been playing with the mouse all along That was the final PPV match for Shawn Michaels for four and a half years It helped establish Austin as the biggest star in the wrestling business and the mainstream publicity garnered by Tyson s appearance proved a crucial turning point in the WWE s battle with WCW Austin would go on to become the biggest star in WWE History and along with the Rock Mick Foley the Undertaker and Triple H lead the WWE through the period where they would gain their highest level of cultural relevance And it all started here at Wrestlemania
1	I LOVE this show it s sure to be a winner Jessica Alba does a great job it s about time we have a kick ass girl who s not the cutesy type The entire cast is wonderful and all the episopes have good plots Everything is layed out well and thought over To put it together must have taken a while because it wasn t someone in a hurry that just slapped something together It s a GREAT show altogether
1	This is a gorgeous movie visually The images of the Mexican desert the old mansion the characters in their picturesque costumes all amount to a real work of art The story seems a bit loose but that s because it s not meant to be realistic It is taken from a book called One Hundred Years of Solitude and it is supposed to be an evocation of the isolated otherworldly atmosphere of Latin America so far from God and so close to the United States The tremendous debt that Erendira owes to her grandmother is symbolic of Latin America s international debt burden although there many layers of meaning If you can appreciate a slow moving richly textured movie this one is for you

0	There is no possible reason I can fathom why this movie was ever made Why must Hollywood continue to crank out one horrible update of a classic after another Cases in point Mister Magoo The Avengers awful Christopher Lloyd whom I normally enjoy was so miserably miscast in this role His manic portrayal of our beloved Uncle Martin is so unspeakably unenjoyable to be almost criminal His ranting groaning grimacing and histrionics provide us with no reason to care for his character except as some dimensional cartoon character The director must have thought that fast movements screaming dialogue and one take slapstick had some similarity to comedy Apparently he told EVERY ACTOR to act as if they had red ants in their pants Fault must lie with the irresponsibly wrought script I think the writer used It s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World as an example of a fine comedy script As manic as that classic is it is far superior to this claptrap in fact suddenly it looks pretty good in comparison What is most sad about this movie is that it must have apparently been written to appeal to young children I just am not sure whose children it was made for Certainly no self respecting card carrying child I know If they HAD to remake My Favorite Martian why didn t they add some of the timeless charm of the original classic Unfortunately IMDB com cannot factor in zero as a rating for its readers that is the only rating that comes to mind in describing this travesty One good thing did come from this movie the actors and crew were paid I think
1	The Unborn is a Roger Corman production and as such is nasty and tasteless If you hate pregnant women check out this movie because it s chock full of preggo killings and failed abortions Brooke Adams stars as Virginia Her and her square of a husband go to some fancy fertilization clinic because they can t have kids on their own There they meet Dr Meyerling James Karen of ROTLD Dr Meyerling has had a very high success rate at getting couples pregnant Insert joke here Is it because he s creating some genetic killer supermutant babies That s what Virginia starts to think when she starts having some odd side effects and extreme moodiness from the treatment That s when she starts taking matters into her own hands On this one you ll have to get the rest of the details somewhere else because if I told ya all the goodies this one had you might hurt yourself putting it on your Netflix rental queue too quickly It s a bit slow moving for a while but once it picks up in the final third all systems are go Very highly recommended by me on the strengths of its un PC fetal violence out of seventeen stars
0	Honestly before I watched this movie I had heard many people said this movie was a disgrace I did not believe that since Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey have taken roles in this movie and watched it by my own Apparently they were right I was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie why the hell did I watch this movie Of course I was not expecting much from Justin as he really does not belong in the movie theater business But Morgan and Kevin I could not stop asking myself why the heck they agreed to take part in Edison To be honest their roles are rather stupid Well you might think if the players suck then I should pay more attention to the story It is indeed story is the core of a movie but guys trust me this is not a movie you want to give a credit for its story Imagine this a smart ass journalist Justin Timberlake wrote a story against the system and at the same time learning how to become a real journalist from his boss Morgan Freeman This all was supported by one agent who still has heart for justice LL Cool J and an brilliant investigator Kevin Spacey At the end they beat the system with a happy ending story Jeez I could not even carry on with this Just recalling the movie is making me sick already My advise guys don t watch this Please save your money and time for another movie
1	this is what i call a great movie it lives trough the fantastic actor skills and a simple but human story there are real characters which can be funny and dramatic but the main theme is very cruel like live is the bus driver and his son are collecting people trough the country jugoslavia on their way to the capital Belgrad the funny and cruel situations that happens on the way connect the people and the pigs that travel together watch it and you gonna remember it for life its filled with Slavic humor and lifestyle and another reason for its magic it is hard to get
1	Full House is a great show I am still today growing up on it I started watching it when i was and now i am and still watching it i fell in love with all of the characters especially Stephanie she is my favorite she had such a sense of humor in case there are people on this sight that hardly watch the show you should because you will get hooked on it i became hooked on it after the first show i saw which just happened to be the first episode in it really is a good show i really think that this show should go down to many generations in families and it s great too because it is an appropriate show for all ages and for all parents it teaches kids lessons on how to go on with their life nothing terrible happens like violence or swearing it is just a really great sit com i give it out of stars what do you think OH and the best time to watch it is when you are home sick from school or even the old office It will make you feel a lot better Trust me i am hardly home sick but i still know that it will make you feel better and to everybody that thinks the show is stupid well that s too bad for you because you won t get as far in life even if you are happy with your life you really should watch it and you will get hooked on it i am just telling you what happened to me and everybody else that started watching this awesome show well i need must go to have some lunch remember you must start watching full house and soon
0	I m going to go on the record as the second person who has after years of using the IMDb to look up movies been motivated by Nacho s film The Abandoned to create an account and post a comment This was hands down the worst movie I ve ever seen in my entire life The plot was on the verge of non existence and none of the puzzle pieces added up in any way whatsoever The acting was laughable and the writing was embarrassing How this film got backed and came to be is completely beyond me The only saving grace I could find was Anastasia Hille s cunning and repetitive use of the f word and brilliant sound design If I were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being mauled by wild bores I would be up against a difficult decision I m disappointed that I am unable to give it stars
1	This is an excellent stand up DVD Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I have seen in years His routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it I HIGHLY recommend this one The part about the history of Europe is a bit slow but the ending jokes in French are quite good because you don t have to speak French to get it although if you do it is still hilarious Also the parts about being a transvestite are quite good The first scene about San Francisco is not great but funny the first time Skip over those if you can It s almost not worth watching However this really is a funny funny stand up show that everyone should see I was dead at the time
1	The Hanson brothers Andy apparently has his act together and Hank clearly doesn t have his act together need money Andy comes up with a scheme to get some dough that will have consequences for the whole Hanson family This film delivers This is a layered full blooded roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it is doing As a crime drama thriller I would happily compare it to No Country For Old Men While both films have have an ample supply of character drama and thrills Devil is more on the thriller side because of its fast pace No Country is a colder and bleaker film that you can really admire while Devil is a bit more enjoyable There is definitely less violence in Devil than No Country The acting delivers as well Ethan Hawke sometimes wooden in the past brings the jitters sweating and the deer in the headlights look to the besieged Hank Philip Seymour Hoffman as Andy has the film s hardest scenes and is fast becoming the actor who you believe can do anything There s really not much wrong with this film It jumps back and forth without being confusing Events spiral out of control but the film never does the writing from first timer Kelly Masterson directing veteran Sidney Lumet and the editing stay as tight as a drum In many categories this is award caliber stuff though maybe films like The Departed and No Country squeezed this one out of the limelight If you liked those you ll like this
1	This is a good family show with a great cast of actors It s a nice break from the reality show blitz of late There is nothing else quite like it on television right now either unless you count Joan of Arcadia as being similar because it has a teen lead character too Anyway Clubhouse is worth a look because Jeremy Sumpter gives the main character Pete Young a kind of likability and naivet that is appealing without being overly sweet and cuddly Dean Cain Christopher Lloyd Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms round out the rest of the main cast members and each is terrific in their role I really like Kirsten Storms as Pete s sister Betsy she is quite a pill but she still cares about her mom and brother even though she hates to show it It may take a few episodes to really find it s legs but Clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while so check it out people you ll be glad you did
1	Yokai Daisenso is a children s film by Takashi Miike but as you might expect it s probably a bit too dark scary for younger ones However older children may well eat this up that is if you play it dubbed in English The story is that of a young boy who has moved with his mother to the country to live with his grandfather after a divorce During a village festival the boy is chosen as a Kirin rider a great honor but with that honor comes much danger and adventure of course Meanwhile evil doings are at hand as a woman in a white mini skirt go go boots a beehive hair do teams up with an evil Yokai to turn people s resentments and discarded items against them And this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that heads for the City of Rage itself Tokyo One quite funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city says one Oh it s only Gamera The young boy has befriended Yokai which are monsters of a kind mostly benign that have isolated themselves away from humans and all the Yokai in Japan band together to fight the evil In many ways Miike crew have taken the late s early s Yokai films and turned them into a modern action adventure film for older kids that also combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of Transformers The look and feel of the film is great the effects are entertaining and some of the humor will just sail right over kid s heads but still older ones might enjoy it As for adults there s not much here not to like if you re a fan of Japanese monster movies you ll enjoy the heck out of this Cool fun stuff kind of dark at times but perhaps that s just Miike and what a wild ride out of
1	I saw this ages ago when I was younger and could never remember the title until one day I was scrolling through John Candy s film credits on IMDb and noticed an entry named Once Upon a Crime Something rang a bell and I clicked on it and after reading the plot summary it brought back a lot of memories I ve found it has aged pretty well despite the fact that it is not by any means a great comedy It is however rather enjoyable and is a good riff on a Hitchcock formula of mistaken identity and worldwide thrills The movie has a large cast of characters amongst them an American couple who find a woman s dog while vacationing in Europe and decide to return it to her for a reward only to find her dead body upon arrival From there the plot gets crazier and sillier and they go on the run after the police think they are the killers Kind of a mix between It s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World and a lighter Hitchcock feature this was directed by Eugene Levy and he managed to get some of his good friends such as John Candy to star in it The movie is mostly engaging due to its cast and the ending has a funny little twist that isn t totally unpredictable but also is kind of unexpected
0	As a big fan of gorilla movies in general I anticipated that this one would be great and as for the gorilla effects They were quite good however that is the only thing I can write about this flop The film claims to be based on a true story but in effect it does not even come close to what actually happened to Buddy who in real life was the famous Gargantua sold to Ringling Bros by our supposed heroic Gertrude Lintz known by many animal enthusiasts as a woman who hardly had her animals welfare in the best interest As far as Buddy being portrayed as becoming aggressive this was total fiction and at no time did the gorilla in real life resort to such behavior buddy did in fact escape his wooden crate not a plush cage room as depicted in movie during a storm to seek shelter and comfort in the house which frightened Gertrude Lintz into selling him No Buddy was not released into a gorilla family surrounded by lush trees in a zoological paradise he was abandoned in a wooden crate deep in the back of a garage for some time with only a single light bulb for comfort and then sold to the circus where he actually lived a better life having peanuts thrown at him until he died historically the oldest living gorilla on record by the way before a show in Miami Notice also in the film how Buddy grows older but the chimpanzees never age The chimps by the way were not raised simultaneously with other animals including Buddy as portrayed in the film
0	One of Scorsese s worst An average thriller the only thing to recommend it is De Niro playing the psycho The finale is typically of this genre i e over the top with yet another almost invincible immune to pain villain I didn t like the s original and this version wasn t much of an improvement on it I have no idea why Scorsese wasted his time on a remake Then again considering how bad his recent movies have been I m referring to his dull Buddhist movie and all the ones with his new favourite actress the blond girl Di Caprio this isn t even that bad by comparison And considering Spielberg wanted to do the remake could have been far worse
0	Horror spoofs are not just a thing of the st century Way before the Scary Movie series there were a few examples of this genre mostly in the s But like said franchise most of these films are hit or miss Some like Elvira Mistress of the Dark mostly rise above that but other like Saturday the th and it s sequel fail to deliver the laughs But out of all these types of films there is one particularly big offender and that s Transylvania a major waste of time for many reasons Pros A great cast that does it s best Some of the dopey humor is amusing A corny but catch theme song Some good Transylvanian locations Cons Threadbare plot Mostly tedious pacing Most of the humor just doesn t cut it The monsters are given little to do and little screen time I thought this was supposed to be a spoof of monster movies Lame ending that will likely make viewers angry Final thoughts This is a comedy If it is then why are the really funny bits so few and far in between Comedies are supposed to make us roll on the floor not roll our eyes and yawn aching for it to be over I can t believe Anchor Bay released this tired junk I ll admit it s not one of the worst films ever made but it s not worth anyone s time or money even if you re a fan of any of the actors See Transylvania Twist instead My rating
1	Walt Disney s CINDERELLA takes a story everybody s familiar with and embellishes it with humor and suspense while retaining the tale s essential charm Disney s artists provide the film with an appealing storybook look that emanates delectable fairy tale atmosphere It is beautifully if conventionally animated the highlight being the captivating scene where the Fairy Godmother transforms a pumpkin into a majestic coach and Cinderella s rags to a gorgeous gown Mack David Al Hoffman and Jerry Livingston provide lovely songs like A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes and Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo that enhance both the scenario and the characters Even though CINDERELLA s story is predictable it provides such thrilling melodrama that one shares the concerns and anxieties of the titular heroine and her animal friends Both the wicked stepmother and her dreadful cat Lucifer present a formidable menace that threatens the dreams and aspirations of Cinderella and the mice It is this menace that provides the story with a strong conflict that holds the viewers interest The film s suspense however is nicely balanced by a serene sweetness especially in the musical numbers It is in these segments that reveal the appealing personalities of Cinderella and her friends moving the viewers to care for them Overall Walt Disney s CINDERELLA is wonderful family entertainment that has held up remarkably well after half a century
0	I don t have much to say about this movie It could have been a wonderful tour de force for Peter Sellers but it is one of the most tragic misfires in movie history That it was Sellers final movie makes it all the more painful The terrible screenplay direction and shockingly wooden performances all come dreadfully together to make this one of the most unwatchably awful movies ever made I wish so much that I could find even a snicker or a chuckle buried somewhere in this pile of putrid blubber but it s a lifeless humorless disaster The truth hurts Peter why couldn t you have stopped at BEING THERE
0	Watching Josh Kornbluth act in this movie reminds me of my freshman TV production class where the not funny had the chance to prove just how unfunny they really were OBVIOUS is the word that comes to mind when I try to synopsize this wannabe comedy The jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed The delivery is painfully bad OUCH The writing is simply dorkish It is akin to a Bob Saget show Watching this movie is as painful as watching a one and a half hour long Saturday Night Live skit post Belushi I hated this movie and want my money back
0	Unremarkable and unmemorable remake of an old celebrated English film Although it may be overly maligned as a total disaster which it is not it never builds any tension and betrays its TV origins Richard Burton sleepwalks through his role and Sophia Loren s closed in this movie face doesn t display much passion either
1	I am obsessed The story is amazing and the show is highly addictive but I love it I am on Season disc and I tell you that I am too attached to the characters now For anything bad to happen to them would seriously affect my vote for the show And Michael is on my list now Kidding I am so happy to see there is a Season because I was too afraid to go onto disc thinking that it would be ending I can t wait to see the rest now Thanks to the directors producers and actors of Lost I enjoy watching TV again Before Lost I surfed through every channel going to bed sad because of my disappointment in television but I have to say that Lost is my kind of entertainment
0	This is a bad movie Not one of the funny bad ones either This is a lousy bad one It was actually painful to watch The direction was awful with lots of jumping around and the green and yellow hues used throughout the movie makes the characters look sickly Keira Knightly was not convincing as a tough chick at all and I cannot believe Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke signed on for this criminal waste of celluloid The script was terrible and the acting was like fingernails across a chalkboard If you haven t seen it don t You are not missing anything and will only waste two hours of your life watching this drivel I have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them due to their faults This one is just a waste of time
0	I had high hopes for Troy and I am so bitterly disappointed The film was directed so badly it made my stomach ache The pacing was so slow the dialogue laughable and the film well apart from a nice fight scene between Achilles Pitt and Hector Bana the rest was shallow And why oh why does Hollywood always insist on rewriting stories to fit consumer approval Agamemnon didn t die in Troy the war lasted years and Achilles was killed by Paris OUTSIDE the walls of Troy with an arrow to the ankle It annoys me that such a classic story as this is turned into a soap And don t even start me on the lack of chemistry between Helen and Paris She was the woman the war was fought over and it didn t even look as if the two of them cared a great deal about the other No sparks no emotion no hope I have to say in the films defence Brad Pitt Eric Bana and Peter O Toole acted very well with a bad script but that isn t enough to save this awful movie Can anybody tell me where the million budget went Maybe in all the trees they used for the funeral pyres where did they get all those trees I am so disappointed it hurts
0	Problem Child is one of the goofiest movies ever made It s not the worst though some people will disagree with me on that but it s not the best either It s about a devilish year old boy who wrecks comic havoc on a childless couple John Ritter Amy Yasbeck who foolishly adopts him This film is too silly and unbelievable because I don t buy for one second that a child could act as unrurly as the kid does in this film It s asinine and preposterous although I did laugh several times throughout I really don t know why But I can t recommend this film I know I m being too kind to it If there is one positive thing about Problem Child is that it s better than the sequel which was just awful out of four
1	I ve seen this movie and I must say I m very impressed There are not much movies I like but I do like this one You should see this movie by yourself and comment it because this is one of my most favorite movie I fancy to see this again Action fused with a fantastic story Very impressing I like Modesty s character Actually she s very mystic and mysterious I DO like that The bad boy is pretty too Well actually this whole movie is rare in movieworld I considered about the vote of this movie I thought this is should be a very popular movie I guess wrong It was ME who was very impressed about this movie and I hope I m not the only one who takes only the cost to watch this one See and vote
0	This has got to be the worst horror movie I have ever seen I remember watching it years ago when it initially came out on video and for some strange reason I thought I enjoyed it So like an idiot I ran out to purchase the DVD once it was released what a tragic mistake I won t even bother to go into the plot because it is so transparent that you can see right through it anyhow I am a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis so I am accustomed to cheesy gore effects and bad acting but these people take this to a whole different level It is almost as if they are intentionally trying to make the worst movie humanly possible if that was their goal they suceeded If they intended to make a film that was supposed to scare you or make you believe in any way shape or form that it is real then they failed MISERABLY Avoid this movie read the plot synopsis and you ve seen it
1	Jane Porter s former love interest Harry Holt Neil Hamilton and his friend Martin Paul Cavanagh come to Tarzan s hidden away jungle escarpment searching for the ivory gold mine that is the Elephant s Graveyard first seen in TARZAN THE APE MAN only we soon discover both men have hidden intentions namely Jane Will Tarzan stand for that Not likely in fact Tarzan won t even stand for any disturbance done to the Elephant s Graveyard and knowing this Martin attempts to take Tarzan out of the picture only he later finds himself in a world of trouble later he and his party including Jane who leaves with them after she believes Tarzan is dead is captured by a native tribe intent on feeding them to the lions will Tarzan be will and able enough to get to them in time This film is adventure filled with loads of scenes involving Tarzan and other facing down wild animals and a climax that grips the viewer s interest and doesn t let up The cruelty displayed towards animals and the portrayal of native people may disturb some today but all should remember this is basically fantasy adventure entertainment and shouldn t be taken so seriously
0	It was a painful experience the whole story is actually there so I won t go into that but the acting was horrible there is this part in the very beginning when the scientist brother goes to work he actually wears a white coat at home before leaving to work I thought working with biohazard material meant that you should wear sterilized clothes in a controlled environment and the lab itself looks like a school lab there is this monitor on top a file cabinet that has nothing to do with the whole scene its just there to make the place look technical and a scientist is actually having breakfast in the lab and next to him is a biohazard labeled jar and his boss walks in on him and doesn t even tell him anything about it not to mentioned bad acting very bad can t get any worst than that my advice don t watch and I thought nothing could be worse than house of the dead apparently Uwi Boll s movies look like classical Shakespeare compared to this
1	It s utterly pointless to rate this film It s as if you would condemn or praise the newly born for his future life Instead look at it as a powerful meditation at what could have been and what has been in the past years One hundred and eight years of the cinematograpy what has become of the babe I like to contemplate on what would have creatively happen if Europe wasn t interrupted devastated twice by the great wars of the XXth century On her ruins the bogus neon castle of the non creative and reactionary circus named Hollywood erected itself Before French Italian and Scandinavian cinemas were leading the way both financially and of course creatively French film in particular was already threading some very original and creative pathways that could have if not interrupted possibly altered the medium history in some unimaginable ways One wonders what the film history would look like today if it wasn t stultified and choked by the mercantile and cheap political agenda of the Hollywood s years of what Chekhov might define as the reek of greed and harlotry Be it as it might please at least become aware of La Sortie as the key or at least one of them to the Kingdom Thus the birthplace of Cinema Lumiere Brothers Factory Lyon France The date March th there s also a replica reel shoot in the Summer of so if you notice Summer lights and the workers lighter clothing that was the version shown to THE VERY FIRST PEOPLE WHO EVER SAW THE MOVING IMAGES Louis Lumiere creative ideas cinematography direction it was all Louis own domain because Auguste took care of the rest money First film reels were all fifty seconds long the camera le Cinematograph the cameramen le cinematographer having only paltry fifty seconds to make things happen Apparently Le Institute Lumiere has managed to preserve around of these first films executed mostly by an industrious brigade of Loumiere travelling cinematographers criss crossing the globe So all the stars in starry heavens and a minute of silence for perhaps the most magical invention in Human history so far
0	Good movies are original some leave a message or touch you in a certain way but sometimes you re not in the mood for that I wanted something simple no thinking just plain action when I watched this one It started of good and was quite entertaining so why a bad review Well in the end the movie lost it s credibility The storyline wasn t that cheesy at all the action was not too special but overall good acting was OK so more than enough to satisfy my needs But all got ruined because things happened that were over the top and it left me with a bad feeling They should have put a little more effort in making everything credible and would have gotten a in the no thinking just plain action category So in conclusion if you know you ll get irritated because things are happening that seem completely illogical don t watch otherwise I d say go ahead
0	Once again a film classic has been pointlessly remade with predictably disastrous results The title is false as is everything about this film The period is not persuasively rendered and the leads seem way too young and too vapid to even be criminals Arthur Penn s film had style humor a point of view and was made by talented people Even if the version didn t exist this would still be an unnecessary film The version strayed from the facts presented a glamorized version of Bonnie and Clyde but it was exciting and innovative for and it had some outstanding performances that allowed you to care This remake seems culled from the original film rather than the truth as known and the actors in this version are callow unappealing and not the least bit interesting By all means skip this one and hope the version will be better Could it possibly be worse
0	The statistics in this movie were well researched There is no doubt about it Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this movie got the praise that it got Al Gore is certainly quite an actor He sounds so concerned But actions speak louder than words Throughout this movie there are political tidbits and references to his political career sprinkled throughout the movie Jimmy Carter unlike Al Gore is a man of integrity who not only talks the talk but walks the walk as well When Carter thought we needed to conserve energy he turned down the thermostat in the White House and got warm by wearing a sweater Al Gore tells us that we have to conserve energy and claims that we are creating global warming while he travels around in his own private jet How much energy does his jet use and how much more pollution does his jet create How much energy does it take to heat Gore s swimming pool behind his mansion It would be nice if we could conserve electricity by using smaller appliances and making it a point to turn off anything that is not being used But if we did the power company would react to a reduction of energy by calling it a loss in revenue and recouping their losses by raising the rates by So just turning it off would not be a very good idea This movie is a veiled appeal to allow Big Goivernment to take control of everything in the name of saving planet earth that is
1	This is an excellent show I had a US history teacher in high school that was much like this There are many facts in history that are not quite true and Mr Wuhl points them out very well in a way that is unforgettable Mr Wuhl is teaching a class of film students but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way that he uncovers some very well known fallacies in the history of the world and strive to impress them upon that brains of his students Use of live actors performing skits is also very entertaining I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the history they learned as a child turned upside down
0	I m sorry I had high hopes for this movie Unfortunately it was too long too thin and too weak to hold my attention When I realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream I felt cheated Surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper something more meaningful So don t buy a large drink or you ll be running to the rest room My kids didn t enjoy it either Ah well
0	My brother is in love with this show let s get this straight I completely agree with the people who said it was copying off of Dexter s Lab and Fairly Odd Parents I ve never really liked fairly odd parents I mean some things did make me laugh but most of the time it s downright annoying and not cute at all This is almost the same way I feel about Johnny Test Except NOTHING makes me laugh on that show The gags are so stupid and pointless and to tell you the truth maybe it s just me but kids don t DRESS like that Yes I do think Johnny s hair is awesome but c Mon And Dexter s Lab that used to be one of my favorite shows and I still don t mind watching it Which makes me disgusted and ashamed of Johnny Test making an absolute JOKE out of that wonderful show One more thing The Dog Is So Annoying He is more loud and obnoxious than Johnny And the gay accent What the fudge I hate the dog to death and I hope he dies because that would be better for kids to see than listening and watching the obnoxious crap that goes on in that show and picking up a gay accent Unless you want you eyeballs to burn into miraculous flames and your brain fried from this show don t watch it
0	THE TOY BOX BOMBSure I like looking at nude women While I prefer hardcore porn flicks I ll take softcore exploitation grindhouse junk like this too under the right circumstances Well these aren t the right circumstances These aren t ANY circumstances There s supposed to be a horrific subplot lurking in here somewhere but I ll be damned if I can untangle it This is another of those amateurish steaming piles of badly made manure that bores you to tears rather than stimulates you despite all the simulated sex going on all over the place Bah if I want to see good sex scenes I ll watch the real stuff
1	Nothing s more enjoyable for me than a who dun it or suspense tale that keeps you guessing throughout as to how the whole thing will end And that s precisely what happens in DEATHTRAP based on a chilling play by Ira Levin Rosemary s Baby And in it MICHAEL CAINE and CHRISTOPHER REEVE get to do the kind of stunt that Caine and Laurence Olivier pulled off in SLEUTH with just about as much skill and as many puzzles as ever existed in that extraordinarily clever play But because it s meant to scare you surprise you and keep you guessing as to the outcome it s difficult to write a review about the plot Let s just say that what we know in the beginning is all you have to know about the film for the present MICHAEL CAINE is an insanely jealous playwright whose latest play has failed miserably When a young aspiring writer CHRISTOPHER REEVE sends him the manuscript of his play Caine realizes that passing it off as his own would solve all his problems and get his reputation back From that point on it s a matter of fun and games for the audience as Ira Levin s story unwinds managing to trump Agatha Christie for the number of twists Caine and Reeve play off each other brilliantly each bringing a certain dynamic tension to the tale as well as some humorous touches that come from a script that laces drama with humor Summing up Well worth seeing but not everyone is pleased with the ending
0	I saw this movie for a number of reasons the main being Mira Sorvino With her on the cast it couldn t be so bad And it even seemed like it had some mystery and Olivier Martinez was her boyfriend at the time and he was pretty good in Unfaithful The story is set in Spain so it could be an exotic entertaining movie with one of my favorite actresses If you re thinking about the same thing let me warn you this is a truly awful uninteresting boring movie The only adjective that comes to mind is pathetic The story is contrived with sub plots that add nothing to the narrative They try to build a slasher thriller with a look at fascism in Spain but fail horribly The twists have no credibility and the so called investigation leads nowhere The characters are paper thin I didn t care about anyone More than that they re irritating and pretty hateful people The acting is atrocious Mira what is wrong with you Why Mira You re an oscar winner Keep some dignity Her character was weak but that is no excuse for such an awful performance She seems to be sleepwalking all movie long Come to think of it I actually think I saw her eyes slowly closing in some scenes I used to think this woman was sexy Well she isn t here If you want to look at some skin try Romi and Michelle because there s nothing to see here And that accent My god Olivier Martinez is even worst It s too painful to remember his performance to describe it here Im sorry but I can t Ive suffered enough with this garbage This whole movie is depressing It s so bad in every way it s a wonder how it was even made A lousy team to produce a lousy script and make some money over the actor s name Don t fall for it Avoid it
0	as an inspiring director myself this movie was exciting to watch with criticism in mind Shot with low end digital camera probably with mm adapter for DOF The editing is good acting decent sound effects aren t too over the top I would have give it a for an indie film but the story aren t that interesting It s more on the drama side character developments than a horror flick It s not for those who wants to get spooked startled frightened grossed out or sit down with popcorn to just enjoy honestly this movie would be good if we were still in the sThis movie is about a family who has a dry field and that is just that
1	Everybody s got bills to pay and that includes Christopher Walken In Vietnam a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of POWs including Christopher Walken Following a Mad Max Thunderdome fight and a short massacre later Walken and some Colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other Cut to the present and Colombian guy is leading a revolution against El Presidente He s successful at first but after El Presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank he s forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television This is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on American telly which leads Walken to assemble the old squad even though he wasn t actually part of that squad to begin with in order to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of people McBain is a monumentally stupid film but for all that it s also a good laugh and action packed too This is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression or even breaking a window Also it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in New York without the police bothering There s plenty of b movie madness to chew on here from Michael Ironside s diabolical acting in the Vietnam sequence to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes to the side splitting confrontation between Walken and El Presidente and let s not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader being watched on television in America nearly brought a brown tear to my nether eye that bit It s out there for a quid Buy it if you have a sense of humour See how many times you can spot the camera crew too
1	Highly enjoyable very imaginative and filmic fairytale all rolled into one Stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive young and beautiful A kingdom whose king is about to die has said king unleash a competition on his several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of witches want the star to carve up and use to keep them young These three plot threads weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting dazzling special effects and some solid sentiment and humour as well Stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of Claire Danes as the star I could gaze at her for quite some time to Michelle Pfeiffer I could gaze at her at full magical powers even longer playing the horrible witch to Robert Deniro playing a nancy boy air pirate to perfection Charlie Cox as the lead Tristan is affable and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other Mark Strong Jason Flemyng and Ruppert Everett plays their roles well in both life and death loved this whole thread as well Peter O Toole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man Ricky Gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutes nice feet But the real power in the film is the novel by Neil Gaiman and the script made from his creative and fertile mind Stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works
0	Anyone who loved the two classic novels by Edward Ormondroyd will be disappointed in this film All the magic and romance have been modernized out of his original story of a girl who does a good deed for a mysterious old lady and given three in return Three what Not three wishes but three rides into the s on a rickety elevator The first novel is Time at the Top The second is All in Good Time
0	In the third entry of the Phantasm series Mike and Reggie continue chasing the Tall Man assisted by a trigger happy year old a black G I Jane and the spirit of Mike s deceased brother he died in the original Phantasm Number is a rather disappointing sequel since the gore and black comedy is a lot less inspired and exciting as it was in Phantasm II I got the feeling the stress was merely laid on Reggie s incompetence as a lover and his talent as stand up comedian The humor in the previous film was a lot more dry and oppressed which fits a story like this better Also the settings aren t as macabre here plus the constant presence of the Tall Man Agnus Schrim isn t as obvious There still is plenty of gore but not half as satisfying this time By the way beware for the severely cut version as it shows most delightful killings off screen The entire Phantasm series is the lifetime achievement of Don Coscarelli who wrote and directed episodes so far the fifth being in production The first one is a semi cult classic the second is a horror feast of gore and violence and the rest can easily be skipped A Michael Baldwin returns as Mike even though James LeGros portrayed his character a lot better in Phantasm II
0	in this movie joe pesci slams dunks a basketball joe pesci and being consistent the rest of the script is equally not believable pesci is a funny guy which saves this film from sinking int the absolute back of the cellar but the other roles were pretty bad the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people which wasn t even well played instead of the man being an archetypal villain he seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs then there s the token piece that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or something i don t even remember she was that forgettable anyone who rates this movie above a or is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to up the reputation of this sunken film or at least one of those millions of media minions who can t critique efficiently you know the people who feel bad if they give anything a mark below stay away far away and shame on comedy central where i saw this film they usually pick better
1	How The Grinch Stole Christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing Now eight viewings later it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time I saw it Screenwriters Jeffery Price Peter S Seaman of Who Framed Roger Rabbit fame do a fantastic job of adapting the story of The Grinch to the screen Ron Howard s direction brought the story to full life and Jim Carrey s typically energetic performance as The Grinch steals the show Some detractors of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story Having read the original story I must say I cannot agree The movie makes the very same point about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story Indeed it enhances the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why The Grinch became what he was MILD SPOILERS They probably wouldn t ruin the movie for you but if you haven t seen it yet and you re one of those who wants to know NOTHING about a story until you ve seen it you should skip the next two paragraphs I think just about everyone can relate to The Grinch s terrible experiences in school I think all of us at one time or another were the unpopular one in school who was always picked on I know I was and that s why I personally had so much sympathy for The Grinch and what he went through And Cindy Lou Who s naive idealism believing that nobody can be all bad was heart rending When everyone else had turned their backs on The Grinch out of fear and ignorance Cindy Lou was determined to be his friend If only everyone could have such an attitude In fact I think the only thing that might ve made the film a little better would have been to further tone down the adult humor and content It was already pretty restrained but any of this adult humor like when The Grinch slammed nose first into Martha May Whovier s cleavage just doesn t fit in a story like this This one s well on its way to being a Christmas classic taking a richly deserved place alongside the book and the Chuck Jones cartoon as a must see of every Christmas season
1	I can agree with other comments that there wasn t an enormous amount of history discussed in the movie but it wasn t a documentary It was meant to entertain and I think it did a very good job at it I agree with the black family The scenes with them seemed out of place Like all of a sudden it would be thrown in but I did catch on to the story and the connection between the families later on and found it pretty good Despite it wasn t a re enactment of the s it did bring into the light very big and important landmark periods of the decade I found it very entertaining and worth my while to watch
0	There is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the tiniest scrap of talent Nobody in it has ever tried acting before even the extras in the coffee shop look as if they ve been glued in place Nothing looks rehearsed The film quality is terrible Most of the action takes place in narrow corridors or apartments with the cameraman crammed in as an afterthought swinging some cheapo camera backwards and forwards between actors as they deliver their lines No tripod and no proper microphone either there sound quality is terrible Even Manos fares better than this at least they had proper equipment What plot there is simply gets lost in the production mess Stick to home videos preferably made by some year kid trying out the video feature on daddy s new camera phone You will be in for a long search to find a movie more inept than this
1	Joan Crawford had just begun her working girl makes good phase with the dynamic Paid She had never attempted a role like that before and critics were impressed So while other actresses were wondering why their careers were foundering because they were clinging to characters that had been the in thing a few years before but were now becoming passe Joan was listening to the public and securing her longevity as an actress The depression was here and jazz age babies who survived on an endless round of parties were frowned upon Of course if you became rich through immoral means but suffered for it that was alright This film starts out with a spectacular house boat party Bonnie Jordan Joan Crawford is the most popular girl there especially when she suggests that everyone go swimming in their underwear However when Bonnie s father has a heart attack because of loses on the stock market both Bonnie and her brother Rodney William Bakewell realise who their real friends are After Bob Townsend Lester Vail a poor man s Johnny Mack Brown offers to do the right thing and marry her they had just spent a night together when Bonnie declared with abandon that she wants love on approval she starts to show some character by deciding to get a job She finds a job at a newspaper and quickly impresses by her will to do well Her working buddy is Bert Scranton Cliff Edwards and together they are given an assignment to write about the inside activities of the mob Rodney also surprises her with the news that he also has a job She is thrilled for him but soon realises it is bootlegging and he is mixed up with cold blooded killer Jake Luva Clark Gable Rodney witnesses a mass shooting and goes to pieces spilling the beans to the first person he sees drinking at the bar which happens to be Bert He is then forced to kill Bert and after wards he goes into hiding The paper pulls out all stops in an effort to find Bert s killer and sends Bonnie undercover as a dancer in one of Jake s clubs Joan does a very lively dance to Accordian Joe much to Sylvie s disgust The film ends with a gun battle and as Rodney lies dying Bonnie tearfully phones in her story This is a super film with Crawford and Gable giving it their all Natalie Moorehead who as Sylvie shared a famous cigarette scene with Gable early in the film was a stylish other woman who had her vogue in the early thirties William Bakewell had a huge career he had started as a teenager in a Douglas Fairbanks film in the mid s A lot of his roles though were weak spineless characters In this film he played the weak brother and was completely over shadowed by Joan Crawford and the dynamic newcomer Clark Gable maybe that was why he never became a star Highly Recommended
1	This isn t among Jimmy Stewart s best films I m quick to admit that However while some view his film as pure propaganda I m wondering what s so wrong with that Yes sure like the TV show THE FBI this is an obvious case of the Bureau doing some PR work to try to drum up support But as entertainment goes it does a good job Plus surprisingly enough for the time it was made the film focuses more on crime than espionage and Commies Instead it s a fictionalization of one of the earliest agents and the career he chose Now considering the agent is played by Jimmy Stewart then it s pretty certain the acting and writing were good as this was a movie with a real budget and a studio who wasn t about to waste the star in a third rate flick So overall it s worth seeing but not especially great
0	Final Justice has the great Joe Don Baker running around Texas shooting people who shoot people Then he s off to Malta where he shoots more people He gets locked up many times for shooting people Then he gets into a gunfight with the bad guy who is dressed like a monk There is a boat chase and Joe Don winds up in jail again Finally Joe Don with the help from Elaine from Seinfeld kill the bad guy blow up a boat or two and someone gets shot with a flare All this and a catchy theme song just like Mitchell
1	I love MIDNIGHT COWBOY and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine What is interesting to me is how when MIDNIGHT COWBOY came out in it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated X Of course at that time X meant Maturity Since I was only two years old at the time of the movie s release it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then However when I try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film which included prostitution the title itself was slang for a male prostitute homosexuality loneliness physical and to some extent emotional as well abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day I can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release It is worth noting that in the s MIDNIGHT COWBOY was downgraded to an R rating and even though it is still rated R some of the scenes could almost be rated PG by today s standards I want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie Jon Voight plays a young man named Joe Buck from Texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in New York City escorting rich women He emulates cowboy actors like Roy Rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women After being rejected by all the women he has come across he meets a sleazy con man named Enrico Ratso Rizzo who is played by Dustin Hoffman Ratso convinces Joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager Once again Joe is conned and before long is homeless However Joe comes across Ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment Without giving away much more of the plot I want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with Joe and Ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams I E Joe making it as a gigolo and Ratso going down to Florida where he thinks he can regain his health I want to make some comments about the movie itself First of all the acting is excellent especially the leads Although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end there are some classic scenes In fact there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny I find them amusing For example there is the classic scene where Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over Dustin Hoffman bangs on the cab and says Hey I m walkin here I m walkin here I get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of New York City where so many people are in a hurry Another scene that comes to mind is the scene where Ratso Dustin Hoffman sends Joe Jon Voight to a guy named O Daniel What is amusing is that at first we think O Daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why Joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that O Daniel is nothing but a religious nut In addition to the two scenes I mentioned I love the scene where Ratso and Joe are arguing in their apartment when Ratso says to Joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and Joe says in self defense John Wayne You gonna tell me he s a fag What I like is the delivery in that scene I would say that even though MIDNIGHT COWBOY was set in the late s much of it rings true today That s because although the area around nd Street in New York has been cleaned up in the form of Disneyfication in the last several years homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was years ago Also many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the Jon Voight character One thing that impresses me about Jon Voight s character is how he is a survivor and I felt that at the end of the movie he had matured a great deal and that Ratso Dustin Hoffman s character was a good influence on him In conclusion I want to say that I suggest that when watching this movie one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on For example there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings Also what I find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with Joe Buck Jon Voight s character and the people who were in his life in Texas Even the ending while I don t want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie is rather open ended
1	It is no wonder this movie won prices it is a movie that lingers to any soul it isn t a wonder why it took Paul Reiser years to finally give in and talk to Peter Falk about his idea I can understand every part of it this is a movie that will make you cry just a tear or thousands Story When Sam kleinman gets a letter from his wife about her leaving him to find something else his son and him take out on a road trip to find her and while they do that they find something lost Friendship family and affection for each other At the beginning you know whats going to happen but none soever the story is not that easy to figure out from beginning to end it is a ride between a father and his son and a husband and his wife It is no wonder it took Paul Reiser years to write this beautiful romance comedy Actors Well you cant say anything else that what i about to say hey it is with Peter Falk in it he is a legend everything he does in movies are magic when you use Peter Falk in a romance comedy what do you think you get A perfect outcome it is no wonder this movie is that perfect and won that many prices As the son Paul Reiser does an excellent job although he isn t a great actor always that doesn t mean that this didn t work actually Peter Falk and Paul Reiser plays the perfect Father and Son the rest of the cast is good enough but you don t see them as much so just say they do what they shall to get this to shine even more Music It doesn t always work when using music sometimes it just doesn t fit but that is not the thing in this movie the music is perfect in tune it makes the movie even more compelling This part of the movie will shine off as good as the other parts a great soundtrack for a Romance Comedy thats for sure Overall There are so many Romance Comedy movies out on tapes DVDs Blu ray and what not but this movie is one of the special ones it doesn t happen everyday that you can create a story like this it takes years thinking about this and the fact is that actually what it took to make it a great piece that should be bought and kept into the human soul see it when you get old and see it with your father at a old age i think then this movie will spark like no other ever made
0	All the ingredients of low brow b movie cult cinema Topless and bottomless girls kung fu kicking chefs slave traders evil Germans with mustaches Cameron Mitchell and sword wielding zombies And of course the breasts of Camille Keaton who s best known display occurs in the feminist exploitation classic I Spit on Your Grave We also must mention the hooters of jewel Shepard who play a hooker in the recent film The Cooler Lots of blood and action with knives and swords and martial arts among topless dancers in a bar in a whorehouse and on a boat load of martial artists heading to some zombie island where bad martial artists go to die or something like that Tops and bottoms come off easily and frequently as travelers are well lubricated thanks to the boat owner Then disaster strikes as their boat is destroyed and they land on the zombie island where mas monks sacrifice young girls to the dead martial artists to bring them back to life Just when you thought it had everything there are piranhas in the water Yum Yum A big fat German for dinner Just the thing for your next zombie fest
1	THE BEAVER TRILOGY is without a doubt one of the most brilliant films ever made I was lucky enough to catch it along with a Q A session with director Trent Harris at the NY Video Festival a few years back and then bought a copy off of Trent s website This movie HAS to be seen to be believed I sincerely recommend searching for Trent s name on the web and then buying the film from his site He s an incredibly nice guy to boot Don t get confused The cameraman in the fictional sections of THE BEAVER TRILOGY is NOT Trent After having seen the TRILOGY a few times I do have to admit that I could probably do without the Sean Penn version It s like a try out version for the Crispin Glover Orkly Kid section and is interesting more as a curiosity item if you re a Penn fan than it being a good video Penn is pretty funny though and you can see the makings of a big star in this gritty B W video This is probably also one of Crispin Glover s best roles and I would just love to see an updated documentary about the original Groovin Gary Once you see this film you ll never get Gary s nervous laughter out of your head ever again
1	Elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when folks at least folks who might do such a thing sit around and talk about film noir Yet some of the best films of the genre Out of the Past The Killers In A Lonely Place Night and the City manage a level of sleek sophistication that elevates them beyond a moody catch phrase and its connotations of foreboding shadows fedoras and femme fatales Where the Sidewalk Ends a fairly difficult to find film the only copy in perhaps the best stocked video store in Manhattan was a rough bootleg from the AMC cable channel belongs in a category with these classics From the moment the black cloud of opening credits pass a curtain is drawing around rogue loner detective Marc Dixon s crumbling world and as the moments pass it inches ever closer threatening suffocation Sure he s that familiar cop with a dark past but Dana Andrews gives Dixon a bleak stare and troubled intensity that makes you as uncomfortable as he seems And yeah he s been smacking around suspects for too long and the newly promoted chief Karl Malden in a typically robust and commanding outing is warning him for the last time Yet Dixon hates these thugs too much to stop now And boy didn t they had have it coming Hoods dusters mugs gutter nickel rats he spits when that tough nut of a boss demotes him and rolls out all of the complaints the bureau has been receiving about Dixon s right hook The advice is for him to cool off for his own good But instead he takes matters into his own hands And what a world of trouble he finds when he relies on his instincts and falls back on a nature that may or may not have been passed down from a generation before Right away he s in deep with the cops the syndicate his own partner Dixon s questionable involvement in a murder investigation threatens his job makes him wonder whether he is simply as base as those he has sworn to bring in Like Bogart in Lonely Place can he escape what he is When he has nowhere else to turn he discovers that he has virtually doomed his unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty the marvelous Gene Tierney who seems as if she can turn his barren bachelor s existence into something worth coming home to The pacing of this superb film is taut and gripping The group of writers that contributed to the production polished the script to a high gloss the dialogue is snappy without disintegrating into dated parody fodder passionate without becoming melodramatic or sappy And all of this top notch direction and acting isn t too slick or buffed to loosen the film s emotional hold Gene Tierney s angelic soft focus beauty is used to great effect She shows herself to be an actress of considerable range and her gentle kind nature is as boundless here as is her psychosis in Leave Her to Heaven The scenes between Tierney and Andrews s Dixon grow more intense and touching the closer he seems to self destruction Near the end of his rope cut bruised and exhausted Dixon summarizes his lot Innocent people can get into terrible jams too he says One false move and you re in over your head Perhaps what makes this film so totally compelling is the sense that things could go wildly wrong for almost anyone especially for someone who is trying so hard to do right with one slight shift in the wind one wrong decision or punch or most frighteningly due to factors you have no control over Noir has always reflected the darkest fears brought them to the surface Where the Sidewalk Ends does so in a realistic fashion One nit pick of an aside This otherwise sterling film has a glaringly poor dub of a blonde model that wouldn t seem out of place on Mystery Science Theater How very odd But Noir fans heck ANY movie fans who haven t seen this one are in for a terrific treat
0	Like most people I love A Christmas Story I had never even heard of this film and perhaps for good reason it is awful Same locale same narrator same director but the warm fuzziness of the original was lacking Charles Grodin was a poor choice to replace Darrin McGavin but I cannot imagine anyone being able to replace him The story seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original The interaction with the neighbors the Bumpuses is ridiculous In A Christmas Story Ralphie s obsession with the BB gun seems cute but his obsession in this movie is boring Scud Farkus the original neighborhood bully is replaced in this film by yet another kid with braces and a weird hat but with little of the Scud Farkus menacing appeal It would be pretty difficult to equal the original even if this movie had been made with the original crew
0	This is is a thoroughly unpleasant if slickly made movie I tried it because it stars Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum two good actors and because the plot line a mob boss is about to be released from a mental institution sounded promising The movie is billed as a comedy sorta What we have is an endless series of shots you should pardon the pun of people in dimly lit and elegant if somewhat surreal interiors shooting each other in the head stomach kneecap foot heart no part of the anatomy is avoided it seems while uttering vague and cryptic dialogue some of which is supposed evidently to be humorous in a sort of post modern way Goldblum s dialogue for the whole movie could fit on a x card and he wears a single facial expression a sardonic grin throughout Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines do the best they can Burt Reynolds does a cameo The credits list Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop but I somehow missed them good move on their part The whole thing is cold sterile mechanical and unsavory an heir I suspect to the style of Pulp Fiction Fargo and Natural Born Killers If you liked those you ll probably like this
0	Henry Sala s Nightmare Weekend is a rotten piece of sludge from Troma This is a juvenile sloppy and stupid low budget horror film about some teenage girls spending the weekend at a mansion The professor s evil assistant lures the girls into a bizarre scheme to perform hideous experiments Using a brain implant she transforms her victims and their dates into zombies Nightmare Weekend is a completely braindead piece of garbage that features lots of nudity and some cheesy gore not to mention a laughable musical score The acting is horrendous and the script is utterly incoherent Why such piece of crap is widely distributed is beyond me Avoid it like the plague out of
0	The only thing I remember about this movie are two things first as a twelve year old even I thought it stunk Second it was so bad that when Mad magazine did a parody of it they quit after the first page and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying that they had completely disavowed it If you want to see great sophomoric comedies of this period try Animal House It s so stupid and vulgar it lowers itself to high art Another good selection would be Caddyshack the classic with the late Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray before he became annoyingly charming with great lines like greens keeper Carl Spackler s Correct me if I m wrong Sandy but if I kill all the golfers they ll lock me up and throw away the key
1	First things first Edison Chen did a fantastic believable job as a Cambodian hit man born and bred in the dumps and a gladiatorial ring where he honed his craft of savage battery in order to survive living on the mantra of kill or be killed In a role that had little dialogue or at least a few lines in Cambodian Thai his performance is compelling probably what should have been in the Jet Li vehicle Danny the Dog where a man is bred for the sole purpose of fighting and on someone else s leash Like Danny the Dog the much talked about bare knuckle fight sequences are not choreographed stylistically but rather designed as normal brutal fisticuffs where everything goes This probably brought a sense of realism and grit when you see the characters slug it out at each other s throats in defending their own lives while taking it away from others It s a grim gritty and dark movie both literally and figuratively and this sets it apart from the usual run off the mill cop thriller production Edison plays a hired gun from Cambodia who becomes a fugitive in Hong Kong on the run from the cops as his pickup had gone awry Leading the chase is the team led by Cheung Siu Fai who has to contend with maverick member Inspector Ti Sam Lee who s inclusion and acceptance in the team had to do with the sins of his father So begins a cat and mouse game in the dark shades and shadows of the seedier looking side of Hong Kong The story itself works on multiple levels especially in the character studies of the hit man and the cop On opposite sides of the law we see within each character not the black and white but the shades of grey With the hit man we see his caring side when he got hooked up and developed feelings of love for a girl Pei Pei bringing about a sense of maturity tenderness and revealing a heart of gold The cop with questionable tactics and attitudes makes you wonder how one would buckle when willing to do anything it takes to get the job done There are many interesting moments of moral questioning on how anti hero despicable strategies are adopted You ll ask what makes a man and what makes a beast and if we have the tendency to switch sides depending on circumstances do we have that dark inner streak in all of us transforming from man to dog and dog to man Dog Bite Dog grips you from the start and never lets go until the end though there are points mid way through that seemed to drag especially on its tender moments and it suffered too from not knowing when to end If I should pick a favourite scene then it must be the one in the market food centre extremely well controlled and delivered a suspenseful edge of your seat moment Listen out for the musical score too and you re not dreaming if you hear growls of dogs Highly recommended especially if you think that you ve seen about almost everything from the cop thriller genre
1	Just like Final Fantasy brought CG to a whole new level this is a rebirth for motion capture Neither movie nor cartoon this motion picture looks like a homage to the Film Noir Akira Sin City Blade Runner and the new generation of European cartoonists You see Paris the way it almost could be the characters seem as real as you and I They blink trip shiver like real actors in a way never achieved before Don t go watch it hoping to find a mind twister You will most likely figure it out before you re half way from the movie The scenario is certainly too simplistic compared to famous thrillers but this definitely is bliss for the eyes
0	I saw this bomb when it hit theaters I laughed the whole time Why Because the stupidity of it seemed to have made me go insane I look back on it and realize there was not ONE funny thing in the whole movie At leat nothing intentional It IS awfully funny that Lizzie cn chew a piece of Nurplex and become a gigantic carnivorous demon yet her itty bitty little dress is perfectly intact despite the fact that she is now hundreds of times larger than she was when she first put it on Or the kind of movie in which a man can be shocked with a defibulator and only fall unconcious and return to conciousness without ANY medical attention And don t let me get started on the ridiculous fate of the villain that they decided they needed to create conflict Uh huh To the person complaining about Disney only targetting kids The raunchy parts of this film seems to disprove that statement Do we really need Daryl Hannah accusing Jeff Bridges of having kinky video tapes You do if you re Disney and you re out of ideas for making the movie appeal to the above crowd without writing a more intelligent script I am thoroughly convinced that Disney pays off the ratings board so it s movies can get away with murder and still get family friendly ratings What a waste of the DVD format
0	Lulu Louise Brooks works as a typist and is missing something in her life She enters a Miss France contest against the wishes of her boyfriend Andre Georges Charlia and she wins She sets off for the Miss Europe title leaving her boyfriend behind She wins again but returns home to Andre because he has asked her to Once back together her life becomes mundane again so one night she writes a note to him and leaves to experience the fame that is waiting for her as Miss Europe Andre follows her This film is a silent film with a piano music track all the way through It is also sped up so everything seems fast Limited dialogue has been added on afterwards and it is very phony The cast are alright bearing in mind that it is a silent film The best part of the film comes at the end but the story goes on a little too long After watching this I m not really sure what the big deal was over the looks of Louise Brooks she has a terrible haircut that makes her face look fat I don t need to watch it again
1	I can t remember many films where a bumbling idiot of a hero was so funny throughout Leslie Cheung is such the antithesis of a hero that he s too dense to be seduced by a gorgeous vampire I had the good luck to see it on a big screen and to find a video to watch again and again
1	I caught this on the dish last night I liked the movie I traveled to Russia different times adopting our kids I can t put my finger on exactly why I liked this movie other than seeing bad turn good and good turn semi bad I liked the look Ben Chaplin has through the whole movie Like I can t belive this is happening to me whether it s good or bad it the same look and it works Great ending Rent it or catch it on the dish like I did
1	Finally An Iranian film that is not made by Majidi Kiarostami or the Makhmalbafs This is a non documentary an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the system in its ass It s all about football and its funny its really funny The director says The places are real the event is real and so are the characters and the extras This is why I purposely chose not to use professional actors as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness The non actors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a your heart is made of stone b you are blind Excellently scripted the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness It has won the Jury Grand Prize Berlin Dear reader it s near perfect WHERE where can I get hold of it
0	Disney s done it again The company that made Mr Magoo and George of the Jungle has made another movie that barely resembles the cartoon on which it is based and keeps none of the spirit of the original Inspector Gadget was one of my favorite cartoons when I was a young one and for a movie of it to exist may have been a dream come true back then Now that that movie does exist I was severely disappointed even outraged First we have the characters Gadget himself has the gadgets that made him such a fun character in the original cartoon with well done special effects accompanying them and he even has some of the naivete of the original Gadget but he is now more competent and is expected to solve the crime himself while Penny and Brain just watch Penny has little to do while she played a major role in the cartoon discovering the crime and halting it and occasionally getting captured by the MAD agents now she is simply introduced and then forgotten although she does at least sneak into Claw s base Claw is the movie s version of Dr Claw who was a rather sinister raspy voiced man who wore metallic gloves and sat in his chair his face hidden from view as he stroked his cat and oversaw various crimes Now he is simply a man with a claw for a hand with no mystery behind the character Brain and Mad Cat exist in the movie but are rather insignificant to it Even small parts of the cartoon aren t spared in this butchering The famous expression Wowsers was mysteriously changed to Wowser and Gadget s Gadgetmobile now looks different and talks There is even product endorsements everywhere Why is Yahoo advertised on a sign Why does the Gadgetmobile have buttons for M M s or Skittles Fans of the cartoon will hate it others might will likely find the movie below par and when all is said and done this movie is another attempt to make some quick bucks off another old show
0	Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd couldn t save this movie from laying an emu sized egg Based on the classic Phil Silvers TV series it bombed because A It was updated to the s and B The simple premise of the TV series was turned into a confusing feeble and silly screenplay The original TV series used a small cast of talented actors to portray lovable characters acting out simple yet hilarious pranks To expand this premise into a s movie was asking for trouble and it shows No one could pay me enough to sit through this stinker a second time
0	haha you have to just smile and smile if you actually made it all the way through this movie it like says something about myself i guess the movie itself was created i think as some sort of psychological test or like some sort of drug to take you to a place you have never been before When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical piece the tractacus sp he said it was meaningless and useless but if you read it after you were done it would take you to a new level like a ladder and then you could throw away the work and see things with clarity and true understanding this movie is the same i think As a movie it is without a doubt the worst movie i have seen in a long long time in such a unique way first of all this is snipes i loved watching this guy kick ass in various movies and i have suffered through a few weak ones however although you know the movie might suck you would never suspect that it could be as bad as it actually was which is the fun of it i mean this is snipes you know it might be good but it will be alright right smile so this thing on every level is pure boredom pure unoriginality the reference to the professional is both dead on and obvious yet so poorly done as to be comical there is not one character in this movie that is interesting in the least and to make the whole thing more surreal they have a soundtrack that sort of sounds like parts to various Bourne identity type movies only isn t quite right in fact although it seems close to action movie background music it just so happens it is done in a manner that will grate on you fantastically then all the scenes in the total pitch black where honestly since the characters are so flat you don t really care whats going to happen but regardless after it happens and someone is killed you just say to yourself was i supposed to see that what else how about scenes with blinding obnoxious flashing at a strobe lights pace for a period of time that is too long to bear sure let s throw that in how bout this though when you are straining and your eyes cant handle it any longer do some more of these in the dark kills where you really don t see what happened and on top of that lets face it you don t care you were past bored way from the beginning so i drifted in and out a couple times but i caught almost all of this movie and it becomes something you can watch without something that engages your mind on any level therefore it becomes something you can effectively zone out with and begin to think about your life where its going where its been what we are as people and that that is the true magic of this film
1	Ok first I have to point the fact that when I first saw this flick I was years old If I had seen this one two weeks ago for the first time I d probably have noted that this is just another cheaply made cable TV horror film with some well made scenes But when you re nine you just don t care about those facts This scared the hell out of me back then especially those aforementioned Zelda scenes and they still do Nowadays I m kind of hooked to this film I have to see this maybe once in a month and on every new year s eve I watch this with a pack of beer bunch of friends It s like an appetizer for a good party I kinda agree to those people who said that the acting here is pretty unintense Midkiff and Crosby do look like I wanted Louis and Rachel look like but one can t see very much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two Hughes and Gwynne pretty much save the scenes which the Creeds underact What I actually want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that has any kind of similarity to Pet Sematary and I don t mean the zombie stuff here THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS FILM IS CERTAINLY A NOVELTY AND ONE OF A KIND Honestly how many times you have seen a film which on superficial level looks like a cable TV one but leave you with a chill compared to only the best horror chillers out there Alright I busted some of the cast s balls a minute ago but I have to say that all pieces in that level too hone the overall acting to perfection But hey tell me if you really know some film which is similar to Pet Sematary I really would love to know And I don t mean night of the living dead here this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff
0	Ahh the dull t v shows and pilots that were slammed together in the s to make equally dull t v movies Some examples would be Riding With Death the most hysterically cheesy of the lot Stranded in Space confusing and uninteresting San Francisco International horribly dull and unbelievably confusing and this turgid bit of Quinn Martin glamor Shot in Hawaii although you wouldn t know it from the outside shots it s apparently a failed pilot for a lame spy show The real problem is that you don t like most of the characters including the drab main character Diamond Head who seemed half asleep for the entire movie his boss Aunt Mary who had a really weird delivery of his lines and shellacked white hair as well as the a tan that looked like it had been stuccoed on Diamnd Head s girlfriend fellow agent hell I can t even remember her name a skinny wooden woman with a flat way of speaking that is just not sexy or interesting and the singing sidekick Zulu again i can t remember his character s name who wasn t bad in small doses The most interesting person in the whole production was Ian McShane who sucked as a bad guy but still proved his acting chops Alothugh the make up jobs this so called chameleon used to disguise himself were just laughable I have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab that caused him to dress as a South American Dictator cum American General Nor do I care The plot simply wasn t interesting enough to hold your attention for even ten minutes at a time let alone the hour and a half or so it goes on Just call this one Hawaii Five No
1	This movie is bufoonery and I loved it The dragon lord Jacky Chan and his buddy cowboy totally made the movie fun meaningful and just plain silly The movie is a rare blend of a good vs evil fight and somehow the wonders and fun that is growing up Long Shao Ye takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young dragon lord so named because he is the son of a wealthy family and cowboy which include implementing clever elaborate ways to escape studying with the help of the entire household including the tutor competing in rather boyish and idiotically interesting ways to gain the affection of a local girl competing in soccer you will see what i mean and the list goes on Somehow they find themselves in the midst of a fight to save the a shipment of valuable antiques and the lives of several people The movie has its serious moments But they do not depress but rather inspire The playfulness of the boys are not lost in this exchange but is actually employed against evil What I really loved about this movie is how it ends Not the typical confrontation which in itself was awesome but well you ll see Let me just say it truly captures the spirit of the movie silly witty meaningful and nostalgic great movie
1	i totally disagree i thought that this was a great movie for kids dawn wells from gilligans island and promise shown of a barely then known dana plato it was disneylike and for that it can hardly be disregarded as meaningless fluff no it wasn t scary and wasn t meant to be i wont ruin the ending but it was unusual the way that it was done i mean the kids characters were great and i didn t know what to expect in the end the basic plot also had a lot more to do with these kids than you say the fact that these kids were expert fishermen is very central to the plot especially initially it also helps them out of a jam towards the end it also has the plus of not being overly long i think it clocks in at under minutes
1	Indian Summer is a good film It made me feel good and I thought the cast was exceptional How about Sam Raimi playing the camp buffoon I thought his scenes were very funny in a Buster Keaton like performance Solid directing and nice cinematography
0	This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen its horrible Christopher Lee is good but he is hardly in it the only the good part is the opening scene Don t be fooled by the title End of the World is truly a bad movie I stopped watching it close to the end it was so bad only for die hard b movie fans that have the brain to stand this vomit
1	Most movies about or set in New Orleans turn out to be laughably bad and laughably inaccurate examble remember The Savage Bees But I ll make an exception for Tightrope which almost got it right Here s one that doesn t inevitably get it wrong The accents are not too bad yes the yat accent down here is way more Brooklynese than southern the city of is shown the way it is was without the obligatory tourist shots and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a quirky southerner One of the few films to do justice to this city and a good film to boot
0	Any movie that portrays the hard working responsible husband as the person who has to change because of bored cheating wife is an obvious result of years of the Clinton era It s little wonder that this movie was written by a woman
0	Now I ve seen a lot of bad movies I like bad movies Especially bad action movies I ve seen and enjoyed all of Jean Claude Van Damme s movies including the one where he s his own clone both of the ones where he plays twins and all three where he s a cyborg I actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians Hey if nothing else he s got a great ass and you almost always get to see it With DVD you can even pause and zoom in That s why you can trust me when I say that this movie is so bad it makes Plan look like Citizen Kane Everything about Snake Eater is bad The plot is bad The script is bad The sets are bad The fights are bad The stunts are bad The FX are bad The acting is spectacularly earth time bendingly bad very probably showcasing the worst performance of every so called actor in the cast including Lorenzo Lamas and that s really saying something And I d be willing to bet everyone involved with this movie is lousy in bed to boot ESPECIALLY Lorenzo Lamas It does manage to be unintentionally funny so it s not a total loss However I recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either a congenital idiot or very very stoned I was able to sit through it myself because I needed to watch something to distract me from rinsing cat urine out of my laundry It didn t help much but it was better than nothing One point for Ron Palillo s cameo as a gay arsonist
0	After hearing about George Orwell s prophetic masterpiece for all of my life I m now but never having read the book I am totally confused as to what I ve just seen I am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel as i m sure most are but only through hearsay and quotes Without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery and even with it I m still no more educated about the story of than I was before I watched it On the plus side The cinematography is amazing Hurt Burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making Now for the down sides and there are plenty There is a war going on at least as far as the propaganda is concerned but why with who Nothing is explained There are a couple of names bandied about Eurasia etc but they mean nothing without explanation Who is Winston what does he do where does he come from where does he work why is he changing news reports why isn t he on the front line Why doesn t he eat the food in the canteen What is that drink he s drinking through the entire film Why is he so weak ill Why isn t he brainwashed like the rest of them What s the deal with his mother sister What happened to his father A little back story would have been nice no scrub that essential for those like myself that haven t read the book Without it this is just a confusing and hard to follow art house movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going on The soundtrack was dis jointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the Big Brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on I accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it s very annoying all the same Also I know this has been mentioned before but why all the nudity It just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage I personally can t abide the way Hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days We are not all brainwashed simpletons but this is a few steps too far the other way I can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you ve read the book because if this film really is the literal translation that I ve seen many people say I would find it very hard to understand why is hailed as the classic it is There s no denying that it was light years ahead of it s time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be but many sci fi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline I guess I have to do what I should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i m to make any sense out of this All in all very disappointed in something I ve waited for years to watch
1	Usually when we use the word escapist we mean it negatively Warren Beatty s big screen version of Dick Tracy proves that escapist can be good This is truly one entertaining movie As the eponymous yellow clad fearless title character Beatty creates a detective to whom we can all relate ready for action but not without his weaknesses From there the rest of characters are almost a world unto themselves Tess Truehart Glenne Headly is as glamorous as one would expect the hubby of any crime fighter to be Breathless Mahoney Madonna is possibly the most perplexing person imaginable Big Boy Caprice Al Pacino is the average villain ruthless but cool Other characters include the speech challenged Mumbles Dustin Hoffman the over musical Keys Mandy Patinkin and The Kid Charlie Korsmo Charles Durning James Caan Dick Van Dyke Estelle Parsons Catherine O Hara Seymour Cassel Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates also star Oh wait a minute I haven t even explained the plot The plot involves Tracy trying and failing so far to find some way to nab Big Boy Simultaneously some very bizarre events have been going on in town the answers to which may or may not be closer than everyone thinks Of course the main thing about this movie is that it s fun to watch If Warren Beatty was having trouble acting his age then he made good use of that here Dick Tracy is one cool movie
1	Why didn t the producers give that show a chance Of all the junk on TV why didn t the producers give Six Degrees a chance Will the series go on video I would love to see how it ends Put season one on video and sell it I was a loyal fan of Six Degrees and waited for it s return I set my recorder to tape all of the shows Thank God for that I just found out that the show was canceled and I m heart broken I wish I knew it was going to be canceled why didn t they tell us I thought the show was just developing some depth in the characters The writing was pretty good also Steven Campbell Scott is my all time favorite I am SO sorry to see it go
1	Holes is a fable about the past and the way it affects the present lives of at least three people One of them I will name the other two are mysteries and will remain so Holes is a story about Stanley Yelnats IV He is unlucky in life Unlucky in fact characterizes the fates of most of the Yelnats men and has been since exploits of Stanley IV s no good dirty rotten pig stealing great great grandfather Those particular exploits cursed the family s men to many an ill fated turn It is during just such a turn that we meet Stanley IV He has been accused falsely of stealing a pair of baseball shoes freshly donated to a homeless shelter auction by a famous baseball player He is given the option of jail or he can go to a character building camp I ve never been to camp before says Stanley With that the Judge enthusiastically sends him off to Camp Green Lake Camp Green Lake is an odd place with an odd philosophy If you take a bad boy make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun it will turn him into a good boy We learn this little pearl of wisdom from Mr Sir John Voight one of the camp s counselors We get the impression right away that he is a dangerous man He at least wears his attitude honestly he doesn t think he is nice The camp s guidance councilor Mr Pendanski Tim Blake Nelson is a different matter entirely He acts the part of the caring sensitive counselor but he quick quicker than anyone else in authority to unleash the most cruel verbal barbs at his charges The Warden has a decided capacity for meanness but other than that she is a mystery These three rule Camp Green Lake a place that has no lake It is just a dry dusty desert filled with holes five feet deep and five feet wide Its local fauna seem only to be the vultures and dangerous poisonous yellow spotted lizards Green Lake seems is in many ways a haunted place Holes works in spite of the strange setting and the strange story because it understands people Specifically because it is honest in the way it deals with the inmates of Camp Green Lake The movie captures the way boys interact with one another perfectly It captures the way boys can bully each other they way they can win admiration the way they fight with one another and the way boys ally themselves along the age line It is this well nuanced core that makes everything else in the film believable What is also refreshing about this film the good nature of its main character He does not believe in a family curse he is not bitter about the infamous exploits of his no good dirty rotten pig stealing great great grandfather In fact he loves hearing the story Stanley IV is not bitter about the past and determined not let it affect him in the way it has affected his father and grandfather There is at times a lot of sadness in the film but not a lot wallowing angsty silliness And that is refreshing Holes is an intelligent insightful and witty family movie It entertains and not in any cheap way It is not a comedy though it has its laughs It dares to be compelling where many family movies tend to play it safe and conventional As such it transcends the family movie genera and simply becomes a good film that everyone can enjoy I give it a
0	This movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years Not even woody Harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom The murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not nothing is of any interest The cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful I just sat in utter amazement during this movie thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining The producers of this movie were very clever They made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast People will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think Woody Harrison Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe this must be good and rent this movie boy are they in for a horrible time If you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie some people actually did enjoyed this movie but I like to watch a movie with meaning
1	Leslie Charteris series of novels of the adventures of the slightly shady Simon Templar The Saint was brought to the screen in the late s with the up and coming George Sanders as Templar It was a careful choice Sanders usually would play villains with occasional nice roles ffoliott in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE the title hero in THE STRANGE CASE OF UNCLE HARRY the framed best friend of Robert Montgomery in RAGE IN HEAVEN Here his willingness to bend the rules and break a law briefly fit his heavy persona while his good looks and suave behavior made Templar a fit shady hero like Chester Morris Boston Blackie and to an extent Peter Lorre s Mr Moto The films are not the best series of movie mystery serials but they are serviceable Like Rathbone s Holmes series or Oland s Chan s series the show frequently had actors repeating roles or playing new ones the anti heroine in the film here was played by Wendy Barrie who would show up in a second film in the series This and slightly familiar movie sets make the series a comfortable experience for the viewers who hear the buzz of the dialog always showing Sanders braininess in keeping one step ahead of the bad guys without noting the obvious defects of the plot All these mysteries have defects due to the fact that even the best writers of the genre can t avoid repeating old ideas again and again and again Here the moment when that happened was when one of the cast admitted his affection for Barrie which she was long aware of Shortly after he tries to protect her from the police But as the film dealt with the identity of a criminal mastermind it became obvious that this person was made so slightly noble as to merit being the mysterious mastermind i e the script disguised him as the least likely suspect Barrie is after the proof that her father who died in prison was framed by the real criminals in a robbery gang She has several people assisting her mugs like William Gargan and she gets advice from the mastermind on planning embarrassing burglaries that can t be pinned on her The D A who got her father convicted Jerome Cowan is determined to get Barrie and her gang The only detective who seems to have a chance to solve the case is Jonathan Hale who is shadowing Sanders but reluctantly working with him The cast has some nice moments in the script Hale currently on a special diet is tempted to eat a rich lobster dinner made for Sanders by Willie Best He gets a serious upset stomach as a result enabling Sanders and Barrie to flee Sanders apartment Best has to remind him when he feels better to head for a location that Sanders told him to go to at a certain time There is also an interesting role for Gilbert Emery Usually playing decent people like the brow beaten husband in BETWEEN TWO WORLDS he plays a socially prominent weakling here whose demise is reminiscent of that of a character in a Bogart movie On the whole a well made film for the second half of a movie house billing in It will entertain you even if it does not remain in your memory
0	This film is massively boring and pretentious There is only one good moment when a sailor shaves Mr Barney s think the purple dinosaur less pretense eyebrow The music is relentlessly cloying it is sad that Bjork someone with so much inner beauty has been brought down to pretentious falsity in her art The pomp of the tea service makes a beautiful ritual seem vapid the mythology and culture are not respected in this film they are lifted Not just from Japanese culture but from another filmmaker stay tuned In a perfect art imitates life moment the crew of the ship finds a giant piece of sh t Which is what the audience found in the theatre There are some set pieces which are very composed and arty without heart then prepare for spoilers I m talking to you MR BARNEY The Emperor has no clothes Mr Barney you have been outted I have seen Jodorowsky s HOLY MOUNTAIN And your thin fake veil of BS has been lifted You have stolen your images your style and your ENTIRE ART CATALOGUE from this man Now that HOLY MOUNTAIN has been released FINALLY let s hope the powers that be at the Art Councils of the world STOP FINANCING YOU Poor Jodorowsky lost in a financial battle with the Beatles Lawyer when he is the Lennon McCartney of film making And BTW while Jodorowsky is the Beatle YOU ARE THE MONKEES A cheap thin soulless rip off only liked by facile kitschy college freshmen And BTW I am a filmmaker If you are interested in making a reality film I will legally fight you in a ring defending Jodorowsky you defending outright thievery
0	With the rising popularity of the now iconic Godzilla series like with any hit cinema event there was inevitably going to be a crowd of imitators trying to cash in on the success on the big lizard With Godzilla came the dawn of a rising popularity of the kaiju giant monster genre Many sought after success a few gained it One of the few that not only profited but garnered popularity was Gamera a giant turtle that could breathe fire in and out and fly by spewing flames from the sockets in his carapace as a means of jet propulsion But unlike Godzilla Gamera was marketed as a friend to all children later fighting other monsters to save kids in peril and thus Gamera became very popular amongst the kiddies Unfortunately that s about the only audience mainstream that the original Gamera series will have any appeal to While the new Gamera movies directed by Shusuke Kaneko are marvelous revolutionary monster movies the original series including the original is nothing special The first Gamera movie titled in Japan as The Giant Monster Gamera was clearly a Godzilla want to be Even though the movie was produced in the era of color films it was shot in black and white Why To imitate the first Godzilla movie from the s Gamera also attacks Tokyo Because Godzilla attacked Tokyo in the first movie I don t know much about the Japanese version for the version I am familiar with the Americanized version where scenes were cut and new footage with American actors were inserted is it coincidence that the same thing happened with the first Godzilla film Now whether this adds or takes away from the film I cannot say But Gammera the Invincible is really nothing more than a ponderous bore that just plods along like the big turtle himself Gammera the Invincible is a very routine orientated movie The characters are from a stock of science fiction standards the story is inane the monster has no real motive for attacking civilization the acting is laughable and so on and so forth The only thing that differentiates it from the Godzilla series is the ending of the movie but that s also a detractor since the plan that eventually halts Gamera s rampage is completely phony and ridiculous Now the rest of the movie and many other entries in this genre also fit that description but this is a direfully stodgy monster movie And although Shusuke Kaneko would later transform Gamera into an interesting monster with his trilogy in the s in the original series Gamera was not an attractive screen presence He was neither scary nor sympathetic He just waddles around like a toddler swaying with each step and knocks miniature sets over As usual everybody wants to destroy Gamera except for a little kid Yoshio Uchida who was lazily left out of the credits though he plays a central role who thinks Gamera is a nice turtle Most movies in the genre that Gammera the Invincible is a part of are easy targets for criticism and this one is subject to extra pressure Even in the company of many other Godzilla imitators this Gamera film is not a particularly good entry And as far as my cinema experience goes the rest of the movies in the series are either just as boring or worse Like Godzilla Gamera would be filmed in color and go on to fight monsters And like Godzilla he d get cheaper and cheaper with every film until it was time to revive the series and make him serious again It s peculiar Usually I recommend people to stick with the originals and pass on the remakes But in the case of Gamera my verdict is just the opposite I strongly encourage people to watch the s Gamera trilogy directed by Shusuke Kaneko and to skip over the original series unless interested The new films are inventive well made exciting and above all fun The original series is a long stream of boredom
1	One of the joys of picking up the recent Bela Lugosi collection is getting to see delightful movies like The Invisible Ray Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi team up in a movie that delves into meteorites and radiation and while the science is all perfectly absurd especially the camera technique Karloff as Janos Rukh uses to determine the site of a certain meteorite and downright laughable I didn t care in the lease because the movie is thoroughly enjoyable The effects are done well for the time the acting is great and the finish is particularly strong It reminds me of the pulp sci fi comics and novels of the s and s complete with ray guns and ridiculous science You must watch this movie
0	Cute and playful but lame and cheap Munchies is another Gremlins clone to come out from the s I m not much of a fan of the imitations First it was the excellent Gremlins Then came the very average Critters Lets not forget the lousy Ghoulies But the complete pits would have to go to Hobgoblins Is there more Now Munchies for me would have to fall somewhere between Ghoulies and Hobgoblins Actually I probably found it more entertaining than Ghoulies but I preferred thst one s darker tone From the get go it plays up its goofy nature which it s better for it but due to that nature the hammy acting Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips can get rather overbearing that you rather just see the munchies running amok That s where the fun occurs Mostly light hearted fluff though as the story mainly centres on the munchies who are either hungry horny and destructive in a whole bunch of supposed comical encounters some moments do work in the small desert town as a couple of people are on the chase It s silly but strangely engaging thanks to the zippy pacing The creatures themselves look rather bland and poorly detailed as they re basic dolls being chucked about Where their personalities arrived from is that they can actually speak and with attitude Charlie Stratton and a feisty Nadine Van der Velde who was in Critters were fair leads Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles Robert Picardo also pops up Amusingly low cut entertainment for the undemanding
0	No redeeming features this film is rubbish Its jokes don t begin to be funny The humour for children is pathetic and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package Sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next I couldn t enjoy the film at all Although my child for whom the DVD was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new DVD neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again unlike with Monsters inc Finding Nemo Jungle Book Lion King etc which all get frequent requests for replays
0	My dad is a fan of Columbo and I had always disliked the show I always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is But he goes on watching it none the less That is his right as an American I guess But my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that Spielberg had directed the premier episode It was then that I was thankful that my dad had bought this show that I really can t stand I went through his DVD collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college My opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed but I did gain respect for Spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors And that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along get the pun HA HA Like Spielberg did It s like Jesus before he became a man Or thats at least what I think that would feel like Any ways if your fan of Columbo than you would most likely like this even though it contains little of Peter Falk I attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet This episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of Columbo s investigation as many later episodes would do
0	This obvious pilot for an unproduced TV series features young Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as an amnesiac with some pretty incredible powers that must be put to use when a man turned flying demon is let loose on the world The CGI is par for a TV job and Appleby is OK as an amnesiac but hard to swallow as a superheroine Familiar TV face Richard Burgi is along for the ride as Appleby s mentor but he can do nothing to elevate this dreck above the mediocre level We see way too much of the cartoonish flying demon right from the start a bad sign Also the scenes where Burgi is training Appleby for battle are actually laughable They are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other movies most notably REMO WILLIAMS
0	Outrageously trashy karate horror thriller with loads of graphically gory violence and gratuitous nudity and a thoroughly preposterous and bizarre plot This is lowbrow and low grade entertainment that will appeal only to viewers with particularly kinky tastes but it s kind of cheerfully bad and I must admit that I wasn t actually bored while watching it
0	MY EYES IN THE NAME OF GOD AND ALL THAT IS HOLY MAKE ME UNSEE THIS MOVIE what drugs are you people on this could very well be the worst movie ever i felt like i was on a bad acid trip the whole time i need to call a therapist to help me deal with the trauma of this epic disaster From start to finish glow ropes is an unholy masterpiece of satanic cinema when i thought to watch this movie with my Jewish best friend and his family we thought oh hey this may be funny it will probably be bad but still a little funny how wrong we were we were not prepared for how awful this movie could be All of my friends lined up for lobotomies as soon as the film was over and during the course of the movie one of my friends attempted to hang himself with his belt while another tried to slit his wrists with a wooden spoon I wish I had watched the video from The Ring instead that way the pain and suffering would be over in only seven short days For all who wish to see this movie YOU ARE NOT PREPARED you may think you are some sort of tough guy by renting this but this movie will break you push you to the ground and urinate on you
0	One of the cornerstones of low budget cinema is taking a well known classic storyline and making a complete bastardization out of it Phantom of the Mall is no exception to this rule The screenwriter takes the enduring Phantom of the Opera storyline and moves it into a late s shopping mall However the Phantom s goal now is simply to get revenge upon those responsible for disfiguring his face and murdering his family The special effects do provide a good chuckle especially when body parts begin appearing in dishes from the yogurt stand Pauly Shore has a small role which does not allow him to be as fully obnoxious as one would expect mostly due to the fact that his fifteen minutes of MTV fame had not yet arrived If you re looking for a few good laughs at the expense of the actors and special effects crew check this flick out Otherwise keep on looking for something else
0	I ended up watching this whole very long movie because I was fascinated by the sheer stupidity and naivity of it It seems difficult to believe that so many famous people Anthony Quinn Lawrence Olivier John Gielguld Vittorio de Sica etc would have willingly participated in this farce But maybe in people really were so naive The plot seems written by some confused Latin American Marxist priest with an agenda There is a superpower conflict and the Russians are actually the good guys with the Communist Party General Secretary being a nice and spiritual man who suddenly after years sees the light and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner priest from a Siberian gulag The priest then promptly becomes the Pope by a series of coincidences We are allowed to see the secret Vatican papal voting process which is portrayed in the most hillariously pious form you can possibly imagine Meanwhile the communists in China achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of starving half of their country to death To solve this minor hiccup on the relentless shining path towards communism they want to start a nuclear war in order to justly distribute the Western capitalist riches to the poor workers of China Our good old comrade General Secretary gets a bit worried and calls the Pope just before his coronation to ask him to broker peace They meet with the Chinese leader comrade Peng who looks and acts like a year old boy You will roll on the floor laughing about what people in thought the Chinese looked like Comrade Peng demands that the Western capitalists must pay which is quite logical after all don t capitalists always have to pay for the madness of the socialists and that the Pope needs to sacrifice something too for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justice So when the Pope gets crowned in Rome he pledges the entire wealth of the Catholic church world wide to feed our poor Chinese brethren in Christ And thus he saves the world from nuclear holocaust Apart from this there are also some minor sub plots which alas provide little to redeem this incredibly bad movie I d give it three Oscars for stupidity By the way Anthony Quinn looks quite unlikely as a Pope He is much more plausible as Zorba the Greek
1	The documentary presents an original theory about Guns Germs and Steel The series graphically portray several episodes strongly supporting the theory and defend the theory against common criticism I was deeply puzzled to find user comments complaining about lack of new information in these series They say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school Indeed it does In fact I greatly enjoyed the original look at the information which I have known since middle school and the unexpected analysis So if you like knowing WHY things work if you have taken apart the telephone trying to determine how it worked if you have gone to the farm to see how farm works and how cows are milked you will enjoy this series A definite recommendation
0	Private Practice is being spun off the fairly successful and well written Grey s Anatomy The cast is fabulous The premise might even work But the writing is just terrible The pre pilot disguised as a Grey s Anatomy episode should have been my first warning The plot was just blah I thought maybe it was a fluke So I set the DVR to tape the pilot and all other episodes As I was watching the pilot I just kept wondering how a show with such a cast of fine actors could put together a boring pilot The pilot is supposed to suck people in and keep them coming back for more There s supposed to be excitement flash great writing intriguing storyline with a cliffhanger that needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season Amazingly this show had none of that Thinking it was a fluke I just watched the second episode hoping for the best And although marginally better it doesn t come close to what it needs to be interesting can t miss TV I just scrubbed this show from my list of shows to watch Not worth the effort IMO and I would be very surprised if this show even makes it through mid season Pass this one up folks
0	Why is it that any film about Cleopatra the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making Whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest Roman of them all Julius Ceasar and his successor Mark Anthony never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors Despite lavish sets and costumes this movie is as bad as any Italian sandals and toga extravaganza of the s Admittedly this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen which is why Gladiator went over well but Gladiator did not have all the romance novel sex Miss Varela has as little acting talent as Elizabeth Taylor but Timothy Dalton has talent to spare Pity some of it didn t wash off on the others
1	EL MAR is a tough stark utterly brilliant brave work of cinematic art Director Agust Villaronga with an adaptation by Antoni Aloy and Biel Mesquida of Blai Bonet s novel has created a film that traces the profound effects of war on the minds of children and how that exposure wrecks havoc on adult lives And though the focus is on war s heinous tattoo on children the transference to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear This film becomes one of the finest anti war documents without resorting to pamphleteering the end result has far greater impact because of its inherent story following children s march toward adulthood A small group of children are shown in the Spanish Civil War of Spain threatened with blackouts and invasive nighttime slaughtering of citizens Ramala Nilo Mur Tur David Lozano Julia Sergi Moreno and Francisca Victoria Verger witness the terror of the assassination of men and the revenge that drives one of them to murder and suicide These wide eyed children become adults carrying all of the psychic disease and trauma repressed in their minds We then encounter the three who survive into adulthood where they are all confined to a tuberculosis sanitarium Ramala Roger Casamajor has survived as a male prostitute protected by his john Morell Juli Mira and has kept his life style private Tur Bruno Bergonzini has become a frail sexually repressed gay male whose cover is his commitment to Catholicism and the blur of delusional self mutilation crucifixion Francisca Ant nia Torrens has become a nun and serves the patients in the sanitarium The three are re joined by their environment in the sanitarium and slowly each reveals the scars of their childhood experiences with war Tur longs for Ramala s love Ramala longs to be free from his Morell and Francisca must face her own internal needs covered by her white nun s habit The setting of the sanitarium provides a graphic plane where the thin thread between life and death between lust and love and between devotion and destruction is played out To detail more would destroy the impact of the film on the individual viewer but suffice it to say that graphic sex and full nudity are involved in some of the most stunningly raw footage yet captured on film and the viewer should be prepared to witness every form of brutality imaginable For this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and Director Villaronga is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense The actors both as children and as adults are splendid Roger Cassamoor Bruno Bergonzini and Ant nia Torrens are especially fine in inordinately difficult roles The cinematography by Jaime Peracaula and the haunting musical score by Javier Navarrete serve the director s vision A tough film this but one highly recommended to those who are unafraid to face the horrors of war and its aftermath In Spanish with English subtitles Grady Harp
1	In anticipation of Ang Lee s new movie Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon I saw this at blockbuster and figured I d give it a try A civil war movie is not the typical movie I watch Luckily though I had a good feeling about this director This movie was wonderfully written The dialogue is in the old southern style yet doesn t sound cornily out of place and outdated The spectacular acting helped that aspect of the movie Toby Maguire was awesome I thought he was good but nothing special in Pleasantville but here he shines I have always thought of Skeet Ulrich as a good actor but nothing special but here he is excellent as well The big shocker for me was Jewel She was amazingly good Jeffrey Wright who I had never heard of before is also excellent in this movie It seems to me that great acting and great writing and directing go hand in hand A movie with bad writing makes the actors look bad and visa versa This movie had the perfect combination The actors look brilliant and the character development is spectacular This movie keeps you wishing and hoping good things for some and bad things for others It lets you really get to know the characters which are all very dynamic and interesting The plot is complex and keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing and ready for anything at any time Literally dozens of times I was sure someone was going to get killed on silent parts in the movie that were too quiet brilliant directing This was also a beautifully shot movie The scenery was not breath taking It s in Missouri and Kansas for goodness sakez but there was clearly much attention put into picking great nature settings Has that rough and rugged feel but keeps an elegance which is very pleasant on the eyes The movie was deep It told a story and in doing so made you think It had layers underneath that exterior civil war story Specifically it focused on two characters that were not quite sure what they were fighting for There were many more deep issues dealt with in this movie too many to pick out It was like a beautifully written short story filled with symbolism and artistic extras that leaves you thinking during and after the story is done If you like great acting writing lots of action and some of the best directing ever see this movie Take a chance on it
1	What seemed at first just another introverted French flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me on second viewing a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation Spoiler of sorts follows Poor Cedric he apparently didn t know what hit him Poor audience we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch These two guys just didn t belong together from their first ambiguous encounter As much as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for Mathieu an intellectual being to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach On a purely technical note I loved the camera action in this film Subtitles were totally unnecessary even though my French is presque rien I could watch it again without the annoying English translation and enjoy it even more This was a polished very professionally made motion picture Though many scenes seem superfluous I rate it nine out of ten
0	C mon people you can t be serious another case of advertising snuff when it totally isn t This isn t even remotely scary nor is it terrifying or depraved it is just utterly terrible amateurish videowork made for the next party to get the girls laid The gore is incredibly bad even the eye scene is far from making me want to puke but just making me want to take the camera and hit those guys over the head The girl is just laying there rubber faced not moving at all It would have been funnier to use a real doll instead One season of I m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here is more frightening than this one Don t waste your time or your money
1	I ve always liked this John Frankenheimer film Good script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason this wasn t just another thriller is because of Frankenheimer His taut direction and attention to little details make all the difference he even hired porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant You can make a case that its the last good film Roy Scheider made I ve always said that Robert Trebor gave just a terrific performance Clarence Williams III got all the publicity with his scary performance and he s excellent also but I really thought Trebor stood out Frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail murder sex drugs and real porno actors appear in sleazy parts What can you say about a film that has Ann Margaret being shot up with drugs and raped A guilty pleasure to say the least Vanity has a real sleazy role and a very young Kelly Preston makes an early appearance A classic exploitive thriller that shouldn t be forgotten
1	I remember watching American Gothic when it first aired it came into my mind recently all I could remember was the same guy appeared in Midnight Caller which is Gary Cole I don t watch much TV but I watched American Gothic I purchased the Complete Series on DVD this week it s still as good as ever This is one of the best TV series ever the reason I don t watch much TV is because it s just rubbish that s on except for Derren Brown it s all Reality TV or Soaps such as Grease Big Brother etc i m fed up with it I got the Complete Series of American Gothic for form the Asda website that s the cheapest I can find it
1	The British production company Amicus is generally known as the specialist for horror anthologies and this great omnibus called The House That Dripped Blood is doubtlessly the finest Amicus production I ve seen so far admittedly there are quite a few that I have yet to see though The House That Dripped Blood consists of four delightfully macabre tales all set in the same eerie mansion These four stories are brought to you in a wonderfully Gothic atmosphere and with one of the finest ensemble casts imaginable Peter Cushing Christopher Lee Cushing and Lee are two of my favorite actors ever as well as Denholm Elliott and the ravishing Ingrid Pitt star in this film so which true Horror fan could possibly afford to miss it No one of course and the film has much more to offer than just a great cast The House That Dripped Blood revolves around an eerie rural mansion in which strange things are happening In four parts the film tells the tales of four different heirs The first tale Method For Murder tells the story of Horror novelist Charles Hyller Denholm Elliott who moves into the House with his wife After moving in the writer suddenly feels haunted by a maniac of his own creation The first segment is a great kickoff to the film The story is creepy and macabre throughout and the performances are entirelly very good In the second story Waxworks retired businessman Phillip Grayson Peter Cushing moves into the house and suddenly feels drawn to a mysterious Wax Museum in the nearby town The great Peter Cushing once again delivers a sublime performance in this and the rest of the performances are also very good The tale is delightfully weird and the second best of the film after the third The third tale Sweets To The Sweet is by far the creepiest and most brilliant of the four John Reed Christopher Lee moves in with his little daughter The private teacher and nanny Mrs Norton whom Mr Reed has employed to instruct his daughter is appalled about her employer s strictness towards his daughter and is eager to find out what reason the overprotective father s views on upbringing may have This best segment maintains a very creepy atmosphere and a genuinely scary plot Christopher Lee is as always superb in his role Nyree Dawn Porter is also very good as the nanny and my special praise goes to then year old Chloe Franks This ingenious segment alone makes the film a must see for every true Horror fan In the fourth segment Horror actor Paul Henderson Jon Pertwee moves into the house with his sexy mistress co star Carla Ingrid Pitt This fourth story is satire more than it is actually Horror It is a highly amusing satire however and there are many allusions to other Horror films At one point Henderson indirectly refers to Christopher Lee who stars in the previous third segment All four segments have a delightfully macabre sense of humor and a great atmosphere As stated above the third segment is by far the creepiest and greatest but the other three are also atmospheric and often macabrely humorous Horror tales that every Horror lover should appreciate An igenious atmosphere a macabre sense of humor genuine eerieness and a brilliant cast make this one a must see In Short The House That Dripped Blood is an excellent Horror omnibus that no lover of British Horror could possibly afford to miss Highly Recommended
0	Contains Spoilers I did not like this movie at all I found it amazingly boring and rather superficially made irrespective of the importance and depth of the proposed themes given that eventually we have to die how should we approach life In a light way like Tomas in a heavy way like Tereza or should we find ways not to face that question like Sabina How much is fidelity important in a relationship How much of the professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones How much do we have to be involved in the political life and the social issues of our Country Unfortunately I haven t read Kundera s novel but after having being let down by the movie I certainly will I want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie adaptation which is my guess or if it was dull from the beginning I disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece I simply don t see the reasons why What I see are many flaws and a sample of them follows The three main characters are thrown at you and it s very hard to understand what drives them when making their choices The secondary characters are there just to fill the gaps but they don t add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary I did not like how Tomas was impersonated Nothing is good for him He is so self centered and selfish He is not human in some sense But when his self confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone I did not find the interpretation credible It s very unlikely that an artist like Sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in On top of that the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions which sounds strange to me a how can Tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer b how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed The fake accents of the English spoken by the actors are laughable And I am not even mother tongue Moreover the letter that Sabina receives while in the US is written in Czech which I found very inconsistent Many comments praised the movie saying that Prague was beautifully rendered I guess that most of the movie was shot on location so it s not difficult to give the movie a Eastern European feeling and given the intrinsic beauty of Prague is not even difficult to make it look good I found the ending sort of trivial Tereza and Tomas finally happy in the countryside far away from the temptations of the metropoly distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living detached from their professional lives die in a car accident But they die after having realized that they are happy indeed So what Had they died unhappy would the message of the movie have been different I don t think so I considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audience The only thing in the movie which is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters You see them for almost three hours but in the end you are left with nothing You don t feel empathy you don t relate to them you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say I hated the stop the music in the restaurant scene which some comments praised a lot Why Sabina has got such a strong reaction Why Franz agrees with her I really don t see the point The only thing you learn is that Sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality That s it What s so special and unique about it After all these negative comments let me point tout that there are two scenes that I liked a lot that s why I gave it a two The Naked women Photoshoot where the envy the jealousy and the insecurities of Sabina and Tereza are beautifully presented The other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of Prague by the Russians Tereza pictures taken to let the world know about what is going on in Prague are used to identify the people taking part to the riots I found it quite original and Tereza s sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayed Finally there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally designed in such a way that Tomas types are going to like it and Tereza ones are going to hate it If this is the case I strongly doubt it though then my comment should be revised drastically
1	I enjoyed watching Brigham Young and found it to be a positive and largely true portrayal of the LDS faith I think that a remake of this epic journey across the plains would be beneficial since many people today are not familiar with the trials and persecutions faced by the early Mormon church It is an incredible story of a strong and devoted people As a member of the church the single most disturbing aspect of the film most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me much was the portrayal of Brigham Young as one that had knowingly deceived church members into believing he had been called to be Joseph s successor as the prophet Although I understand the dramatic reasons for this plot line it creates the impression that his doubts in this regard are historical fact when in reality both Brigham and the bulk of the church members understood and believed firmly that he had been called to lead the church Brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints rather he led them confidently by inspiration The point is important for Mormons because on it hinges an important aspect of our faith that God truly speaks to prophets today and that Brigham Young like Joseph Smith was an inspired prophet of God Whether or not you believe this statement or not just know that the film does not accurately portray what Brigham himself believed
1	This is a long lost horror gem starring Sydney Lassick Carrie and others and Barbara Bach It is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but it s worth it This film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time It seems that young newswomen Karen Vicky and Jennifer travel to the small city of Solvang California to cover a festival when a mix up occurs involving their hotel room and they seek refuge at the home of Earnest Keller Lassick and his strange wife Virginia Vickie stays behind feeling ill as the other are off to film their story She is soon murdered at the house in a VERY cheesy way by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system she is decapitated by the closing cover of the vent as it comes crashing down on her while she is being tugged through and into the basement Soon Karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face rammed through the vent cover Jennifer is fighting with her ex lover in a rather boring sub plot and when she returns home her hosts whom by now we have discovered are brother and sister and that whatever it is that is in the basement is their son devise a plot to try to murder her as well Virgina does not totally agree with Earnest s plan to murder Jennifer but she is tricked into going into the basement where she meets Junior Here the film turns almost comic as Junior portrayed hysterically by Stephen Furst is a deformed mentally deficient manchild whose actions and motions will cause a few chuckles even though it s supposed to be scary This is where the pace of the film picks up and the ending is well done The actors actresses do a terrific job with the material especially Lassick Furst and Bach and although it s not the most horrifying film ever made it is highly entertaining
0	What a terrible film It sucked It was terrible I don t know what to say about this film but DinoCrap which I stole from some reviewer with a nail up his ass AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH sigh It s not Roger Corman that I hate it s this god awful movie Well really But what can you expect from a movie with Homoeric computer graphics Which is another thing the CGI sucked out loud I hate this movie dreadfully This is without a doubt the worst Roger Corman B Movie and probably the gayest B Movie too It s it s DINOCRAP I m sorry I must have offended some nerds in these moments It s just an awful movie
1	My comment would have been added to the RELEASE DATE section but I couldn t find a place for it I was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the U S in Feb I saw it in a first run theater in Washington D C in March Wonder if it was re released or some problem In my opinion this movie is very light entertainment but has some classic characters John McIntyre does a bang up job as a corrupt judge entrepreneur thief Walter Brennan does basically the same role he did in Red River years earlier And in my opinion James Stewart gives as fine a performance as he ever did I have seen this movie a half dozen times or more and never tire of seeing parts of it again The photography and scenery are splendid and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty six minutes
0	I was expecting a very funny movie Instead I got a movie with a few funny jokes and many that just didn t work I didn t like the idea of bringing in Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty s descendants It was confusing It would have been more funny if they just had someone new instead of Moriarty resurrected Some of the things were funny Burt Kwouk was very funny as always McCloud on the horse was funny The McGarrett from Hawaii was not even McGarrett like Connie Booth obviously is very good with accents She is from Indiana but played English and a New Yorker pretty well Unfortunately she was not presented much into the script I was expecting a more funny film Instead I got a rather confusing movie with a poor script Rather ironic since both Booth and Cleese were together on this one Maybe they were about to break up in
1	This is a very entertaining flick considering the budget and its length The storyline is hardly ever touched on in the movie world so it also brought a sense of novelty The acting was great P z to Dom and the cinematography was also very well done I recommend this movie for anyone who s into thrillers it will not disappoint you
0	Hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder once did the majestic and very funny Maitresse and now only seems to do by the numbers Hollywood thrillers This is very lightweight John Grisham material crossed with the plot of a TV movie Bullock is Cass Mayweather a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers Ben Chaplin is her reserved police partner Sam Kennedy and together they make an uncomfortable duo Not good when two unbalanced college maladriots Gosling and Pitt decide to send them on a wild goose chase by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene Fair enough but while Bullock and Chaplin fail to create any sparks we also have to endure a several dull overly melodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in Cass s history Then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliff side log cabin where there s absolutely no doubt the OTT ending will be set Oooh the atmosphere Watch any episode of CSI instead It s to the point and far more exciting
0	This film is something like a sequel of White Zombie since it is made by the same man Halperin and features zombies Halperin the George A Romero of his day fails to deliver with this one though We have a man who can control the minds of people in Cambodia and a search to destroy the source of his power so the zombies can be sent free Also a love interest for the evil man Where this film really excels is in the imagery The Cambodian temples and dancers are very nice and the zombie look very powerful in their large numbers Unfortunately we don t really get to see much of the zombies in action and the love story seems to play a much too large role for a horror film though this has a valid plot reason later on I would have loved to see some s zombies attack helpless city folk but this film just did not deliver And no strong villain like Bela Lugosi was waiting to do battle against our heroes And the use of Lugosi s eyes A nice effect but misleading as he is never in the film why not recreate this with the new actor s eyes Overall a film that could be a great one with a little script re working and could someday be a powerful remake especially if they keep it in the same post war time frame Heck if they can fix up The Hills Have Eyes then this film has hope
1	I LOVE this movie Director Michael Powell once stated that this was his favorite movie and it is mine as well Powell and Pressburger created a seemingly simple superbly crafted story the power of love against the powers that be However its deception lies in the complexity of its is it real or is it imaginary premise Basically one could argue that it is simply a depiction of the effects of war on a young poetically inclined airman during WWII Or is it The question is never answered one way or the other Actually it is never even asked This continuous understatement is part of the film s appeal The innovative photography and cinematography even includes some nice touches portraying the interests of the filmmakers For instance Pressburger always wanted to do a cinematic version of Richard Strauss opera Der Rosenkavalier about a young th century Viennese aristocrat This is evident in the brief interlude in which Conductor dressed in all his finery holds the rose which appears silver in heaven The music even has a dreamy quality All of the acting is first rate David Niven is at his most charming and he has excellent support from veteran Roger Livesey and relative newcomer Kim Hunter But in my opinion the film s charm comes from Marius Goring as Conductor He by far has the most interesting role filling each of his scenes with his innocent lightheartedness brightening the film It s a pity that some of Conductor s scenes were left on the cutting room floor It is also a pity that Goring s comedic talents are rarely seen again on film except in the wonderful videos of The Scarlet Pimpernel television series from the s This is by far and away the most memorable role of his film career He is a perfect foil for relaxed style of Niven and his virtual overstatement contrasts so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters Ironically also in the mid s Niven also starred against another heavenly messenger played by Cary Grant in The Bishop s Wife Their acting styles were so similar that I found the result boring unenergetic and disappointing As a note according to Powell Goring desperately wanted the role of Peter Carter initially refusing Conductor It s a good thing he gave in and gave us such a delightful portrayal The movie commissioned to smooth over the strained relations between Britain and the U S overdrives its point towards the end But it is disarming in its gentle reminders of the horrors of war the numerous casualties both military and civilian the need to go on when faced with death There is a conspicuous lack of WWII enemies in heaven but the civilians shown are of indeterminate origin Powell and Pressburger could have been more explicit in their depiction but it wasn t necessary The movie may not have served its diplomatic purpose as was hoped for but its originality continues to inspire moviemakers and viewers alike on both sides of the Atlantic
0	Zodiac Killer out of Worst acting ever No really worst acting ever David Hess Last House on the Left No the one from the seventies Rent it it s really good is the worst of the bunch Pretty stiff competition but he is amazingly god awful One would be hard pressed to find a home movie participant with such an awkward camera presence The film actually screeches to a stunning painful halt when he is on the screen Not that the film actually has any redeeming qualities for Mr Hess to ruin It is filmed with a home movie camera and by the looks of things a pretty old one complete with attached boom mike No post production either Come on there has to be some shovelware a five year old computer could use that could clean up this picture Throw in bizarre stock footage pictures of autopsy s and aircraft carrier takeoffs and this is one visually screwed up picture The autopsy pictures are interjected the way Italian cannibal films interject those god awful real life animal killings And the Navy footage is supposed to be some anti war statement Cause we know all the bloodthirsty maniacs join the Navy What in the world is Lion s Gate is doing releasing this garbage It would embarrass Troma The plot is about the Zodiac Killer Last seen in Dirty Harry No the one from the seventies Rent it it s really good Somebody gets shot in the stomach in LA and the cops assume the Zodiac Killer is back Uh huh What can you expect from a movie that doesn t know that DSM IV is a book not a psychiatric disorder and where the young killer older man relationship resembles that of a congressional page and closeted congressman Yeah eighties haircuts and production values meet a Nambla subplot Sign me up
1	Being that I am not a fan of Snoop Dogg as an actor that made me even more anxious to check out this flick I remember he was interviewed on Jay Leno and said that he turned down a role in the big budget Adam Sandler comedy The Longest Yard to be in this film So obviously Snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops I m not going to overpraise Snoop for his performance in The Tenants There are certainly better rapper actors like Mos Def who could ve done more with his role But the point is Snoop did a good job He can t seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal inflections but that s something even Jack Nicholson has a problem doing The point is I found him convincing in the role and the tension between him and Dylan McDermott s character captivating McDermott by the way gives the best performance in the film though his subtle acting will most likely be overshadowed by Snoop s not so subtle acting Being a big reader and aspiring writer myself I couldn t help but find the characters and plot somewhat fascinating It did aggravate me how Snoop s character would constantly ask McDermott to read his work and berate him for criticizing it But you know what I m sure a lot of writers are like that His character was supposed to be flawed as was McDermott s in his own way My only mild criticism of the film would be its ending For some reason it just felt too rushed for me though the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters rather than plot

1	When you read the summary of this film you might come to think that this is something of an odd film and in some ways it is for the primary character of this film Gerard Reve Jeroen Krabb is haunted by visions and hallucinations The visions Gerard see are all more or less subtle hints to what will happen to him as the story continues and it is great fun for the viewer to try and figure out the symbolism used in the film Despite the use of symbolism and a couple of hints to the ending of the film the film maintains a very high level of excitement throughout and does not get boring for one minute This is mostly due to the great performances of Jeroen Krabb and Ren e Soutendijk Christine and the great direction of the whole by Paul Verhoeven His directing style is clearly visible and one can say looking at it from different angles that De Vierde Man is a typical Verhoeven film It will not only seem typical for people familiar with his American films because of the nudity and the graphic violent scenes but it will also seem typical for people familiar with his Dutch films because of the same things and his talent to tell a great story When people watch Verhoevens American films short sighted people might say he has no talent in telling a good story and only focuses on blood and sex That is what some people think whereas I think that he is a very talented director who tries to convey a deeper message in each with each film Although not a good film Hollow Man his last American film is an example that Verhoeven can do more than science fiction splatter movies and maybe companies should trust him more and offer him more various films to helm He needs that Just watch his Dutch films Not only do they show that he needs a certain amount of freedom but they also show that he has remarkable talent De Vierde Man brought him one step closer to Hollywood and is certainly one of his best out of
0	I wish Spike Lee had chosen a different title for his film Summer Of Sam conveys the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer David Berkowitz It s not It s a gritty earthy portrait of NYC street life during the hot summer of when Berkowitz terrorized that city The film follows several young fictional characters in an Italian American neighborhood and their reactions to the Son of Sam threat There s Vinny and his wife Dionna there s Richie and Ruby and several other characters The problem is that these characters are not likable They are routinely annoying and at times unbearable Lee then belabors their high energy chaotic lives which are filled with anger lust and general turmoil There are at least two protracted fight scenes between Vinny and his wife redundant disco dance scenes countless gabfests Over and over I kept wondering where s the film editor Meanwhile with all that bulk the film passes up the chance to convey any real sense of fear or dread arising from the Son of Sam menace which is too much in the background Lee is more successful at showing a different kind of menace that arising from neighborhood vigilante groups The acting is uniformly good That combined with s disco music and lavish attention to costumes and production design make you really feel like you are in an Italian American neighborhood in NYC in The film s atmospheric authenticity however is not nearly enough to offset a rambling overblown script about the lives of grossly irritating people
1	I would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster I would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a family I found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensions The scary monster although probably not scary to most adults has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might create I found the film to be delightful
1	Huge exhaustive and passionate summary of American cinema as seen through the eyes of Martin Scorcese Needless to say there is never a dull moment in all of its hour running time Many genres periods and directors are all examined discussed more from the perspective of cinephile rather than contemporary director For anyone even remotely interested in American films or cinema in general A masterpiece and the best of the BFI s Century of Cinema series
1	Mario Lanza of course is The Great Caruso in this film also starring Ann Blyth Dorothy Kirsten Eduard Franz and Ludwig Donath This is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary world renowned tenor whose name is known even today The film is opulently produced and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by Lanza Kirsten Judmila Novotna Blanche Thebom and other opera stars who appeared in the film If you re a purist seeing people on stage smiling during the Sextet from Lucia will strike you as odd even if Caruso s wife Dorothy just had a baby girl Also it s highly unlikely that Caruso ever sang Edgardo in Lucia the role lay too high for him In taking dramatic license the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of Caruso s life What was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire yet this is never mentioned in the film These roles include Maurizio in Adriana Lecouvreur and Dick Johnson in Girl of the Golden West There is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga The reason for that photo His only shirt was in the laundry He was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the Victor Talking Machine Company later RCA Victor He was singing Jose in Carmen in San Francisco the night of the earthquake Instead the MGM story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of Martha which never happened He had a hemorrhage during L Elisir d amore at the Met and could not finish the performance he only sang three more times at the Met his last role as Eleazar in La Juive What killed him The same thing that killed Valentino peritonitis His first role at the Met was not Radames in Aida as indicated in the film but the Duke in Rigoletto So when it says on the screen suggested by Dorothy Caruso s biography of her husband that s what it was suggested What is true is that Dorothy s father disowned her after her marriage and left her of his massive estate They also did have a daughter Gloria together who died at the age of on However Caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married Dorothy Some people say that Lanza s voice is remarkably like Caruso s but just listen to Caruso sing in the film Match Point Caruso s voice is remarkably unlike Lanza s In fact from his sound had he wanted to Caruso could have sung as a baritone He is thought to have had some trouble with high notes further evidence of baritone leanings and the role he was preparing when he died was Othello a dramatic tenor role which Lanza definitely was not Lanza s voice deserved not to be compared with another He made a unique contribution to film history popularizing operatic music He sings the music in The Great Caruso with a robust energy he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career His acting is natural and genuine Ann Blyth is lovely as Dorothy and gets to sing a little herself Really a film for opera lovers and Lanza fans which are probably one and the same
0	I rented this movie yesterday and can hardly express my disappointment in little Laura Ingalls for getting involved in something so poorly produced I am not sure if it was horrible writing or bad directing or both but it leaves a viewer very disappointed in having wasted the time to watch this swill It consisted of a weak naive story line very poor lines and relied solely on pretty scenery and pretty people to sell it Unfortunately this was not enough You would be better off to rent a tape full of static than to waste your time on this crap Lindsey Wagner also played a pretty pathetic part as a ranch owner who apparently works very hard doing nothing anybody who has ever been near a ranch knows that this was obviously written by a young person from los Angeles and not someone with much knowledge of the world

1	The United States of Kiss My Ass House of Games is the directional debut from playwright David Mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller It stars Lindsay Crouse as best selling psychiatrist Margaret Ford who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide In doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels downtown to visit the lowlife place House of Games The gambler Mike played excellently by Joe Mantegna turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty He offers Crouse s character a deal if she is willing to sit with him at a game a big money game in the backroom he ll cancel the patients debts The card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work gaining the trust of others and a fascinating relationship begins What makes House of Games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control is it the psychiatrist or the con man or is it the well known man of great bluffs David Mamet In House of Games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring however in every David Mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings not the direction In House of Games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads showy and distracting but mainly as is the case with much of Mamet s work it is the dialogue which grips you and slowly draws you into the film No one in the House of Games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words Everyone bluffs and double bluffs which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order This is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension House of Games can also be viewed as a class war division movie With Lindsay Crouse we have the middle class well to do educated psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna is the complete opposite the working class of America earning a living by honest crime The film seduces the viewer much like Crouse is seduced by Mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema And the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for it s stunning An extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings
0	Cut to the chase this is one of the five worst films that I ve ever seen Not that they didn t try There was some decent writing with some elements of structure in there a good cast some good acting I m not sure where it went wrong but it went horribly wrong Some of the elements may have been bad structure and no substantive story a lot of overacting by the lead who probably is much better when restrained some bad directing and editing I had enough at about an hour tearing my hair out at about a hour and a half and very agitated at the hour and fifty minutes it ran There was also an insincerity about it all being that I went with someone who used to be a heroin addict He was agitated that it glamorized something that had nothing good to it That was bolstered by the pretty year old girl who was in love with the year old junkie And the frantic nature of the lead was a turn off enough There were clunky plot points that were an attempt at a structure but the end result was listless and unending with uneven time lines The characters were colorful but to no end which made me feel bad for the quality actors who you ve just not seen enough Skip it I assumed that this was a first time director who was enamored by his own turds but he has done this before I m puzzled how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who will actually give them money

0	With all the excessive violence in this film it could ve been NC But the gore could ve been pg and there were quite a lot of swears when the mum had the original jackass bad hairdewed boy friend There was a lot of character development which made the film better to watch then after the kid came back to life as the scarecrow there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of him killing people The violence was overly excessive and i think the bodycount was higher than twelve which is a large number for movies like this ALmost every character in the film is stabbed or gets their head chopped off but the teacher who called him white trash and hoodlum though the character lester is anything but a hoodlum not even close i know hoods and am part hood they don t draw in class they sit there and throw stuff at the teacher The teacher deserved a more gruesome death than anyone of the characters but was just stabbed in the back There were two suspenseful scenes in the film but didn t last long enough to be scary at all As i said the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line get their heads chopped off If the gore was actually fun to see then it would ve been nc Two kids describe a body they find in the cornfields they describe it as a lot gorier than it actually was they explained to the cop that there were maggots crawling around in the guys intestines His stomach had not even been cut open so there was no way maggots were in his stomach though i would ve liked to see that The acting was pathetic characters were losers and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastix stunts I suggest renting this movie for the death scenes i wont see it again anytime soon but i enjoyed the excessive violence Also don t bother with the sequel i watched five minutes of it and was bored to death it sounds good but isn t The original scarecrow actually kept me interested
1	Curl up with this one on a dark and stormy night and prepare to be alternately amused irritated and frightened The creaky old plot about about a phantom train that s said to run through the lonely English countryside at dead of night may be implausible but it s a lot of fun There are some wonderful old cliches like THE ACCIDENT which the locals can remember but won t talk about But primarily the movie s a vehicle for comedian Arthur Askey to showcase his particular brand of vaudeville style humour in between the scary bits Askey s corny humor is not very trendy these days but if you just let it wash over you it can be fun This is probably the best of Askey s movies
0	This movie was absolutely ghastly I cannot fathom how this movie made it to production Nothing against the cast of the movie of course this is all the fault of the writing team You take the old average plot let s dance our way out of being poor and destitute or STEP in this case But this one lacks any semblance of a true plot or at least one that anyone would care about With Canadian speaking actors in what is supposed to be an American setting this film falls very flat On a positive note the directing was pretty good and cinematography was pretty decent as well Looks like the production budget was very generous as well My only request is that this team leave the writing alone and go find actual screenwriters to help them bring words alive on film Net result How she move is How she sucks
1	This is a excellent start to the film career of Mickey Rooney His talents here shows that a long career is ahead for him The car and truck chase is exciting for the era This start of the Andy Hardy series is an American treasure in my book Spring Byington performance is excellent as usual Please Mr Rooney or owners of the film rights take a chance and get this produced on DVD I think it would be a winner
1	Damn was that a lot to take in I was pretty much mesmerised throughout It was pretty perfect though I would say the editing had a lot to do with that I can t believe this guy stayed on good terms with the lot of them Anton especially to get all of this footage without any serious beef The Dandy s did come off well together middle class kids who took advantage of their situation and rightly so I felt bad for Jonestown and especially for Anton which maybe wasn t what a lot of other people felt Great piece of film making and great choice of subject s I recommend this to any music film fan You ll probably learn something about film making
1	I found this movie to be very well paced The premise is quite imaginative and as a viewer I was pulled along as the characters developed The pacing is done very well for those that like to think enough is kept hidden from the viewer early on and questions keep arising which are later answered producing a well thought out and very satisfying film both cerebrally and from an action standpoint It seems some people were looking for a non stop roller coaster ride with this film one of those that comes charging out of the gate This would be more analogous to one of those coasters that first takes you slowly up the hill creating a wonderful sense of anticipation and is ultimately in my mind more fulfilling for the foundation initially laid Excellent film
0	The characters are unlikeable and the script is awful It s a waste of the talents of Deneuve and Auteuil
0	Gadar is an example of one of Bollywood worst overrated movies ever Directed by Anil Sharma who prefers making period related movie gives a rubbish movie The songs were boring and ain t the kind of song you want to listen to in your car full volume Sunny Deol is famous for making daft movies where he beats up a bad guys on his own He even kicks a metal jail door Indian and kicks a moving car far away Teesri Aankh I can give another examples of disgraceful action by Sunny Deol But I m sure most people know this already Sunny gives a pathetic performance once again repeating the same type of role A guy claiming to be fighting for his countries piece by using violence Amisha Patel is hands down dead sexy with an amazing body that i would love to bone But even she couldn t save the film from being a disaster Instead of wearing sexy clothes like she usually does in this movie she doesn t Maybe cos she was playing a Muslim but she doesn t act like one in the movie Overall this is a poor show all the way I m sure it will appeal to some people who love seeing the Bollywood actor beat up guys Give me a break
1	The zenith of two brilliant careers David Lynch better known for less accessible material crafts a delicate and exquisite story around the most unlikely premise A man travels to see his estranged brother Having no other means of transportation his journey takes him over six weeks on a lawn mower Richard Farnsworth in his last film delivers a stunningly layered and nuanced performance in the starring role Achingly beautiful in its exultation of small things Straight Story is a classic cinema experience that must not be missed Sissy Spacek is notable as Farnsworth s daughter an impaired middle aged woman living with the loss of her children
1	Before he became defined as Nick Charles in the Thin Man Series William Powell played another urbane detective named Philo Vance The supporting cast is strong in this early talkie and Powell s star quality is evident Mary Astor who eight years later would be defined by her portrayal of Brigid O Shaughnessy does a good job here as the featured woman who finds herself in the middle of it all
1	The plot is tight The acting is flawless The directing script scenery casting are all well done I watch this movie frequently though I don t know what it is about the whole thing that grabs me See it and drop me a line if you can figure out why I like it so much
1	Meryl Streep is such a genius Well at least as an actress I know she s been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents but she nails the accent every time Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring Mrs Chamberlain as portrayed here was not particularly likable nor all that smart But that just makes Streep s work all the more remarkable I think she is worth all or so of her Oscar nominations About the film well there were a couple of interesting things I don t know much about Australia but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story I had largely missed this when I first saw the film some years ago but it came through loud and clear yesterday And it seems the Australian press is just as accomplished at misery inducing pursuit and overkill as their American colleagues A pretty good film A bit different Grade B
1	The performance of every actor and actress in the film are excellently NATURAL which is what movie acting should be and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that I am never tired of seeing it over and over again However I am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors and director Attenborough s credits that puzzles me aren t they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent long lasting film for the audience I am hoping I would get some answers to my puzzles from some one possibly one of the knowledgeable personnel insider of the film
1	A LAUREL HARDY Comedy Short The Boys arrive to sweep the chimneys at the home of Professor Noodle a mad scientist who s just perfected his rejuvenation serum Stan Ollie proceed with their DIRTY WORK spreading destruction inside the house and on the roof Then the Professor wants to try out his new potion A very funny little film The ending is a bit abrupt but much of the slapstick leading up to it is terrific Especially good is Stan Ollie s contest of wills at opposite ends of the chimney That s Lucien Littlefield as the Professor
1	This is one of the best made movies from Maybe it is not the best movie but it looks the best has great acting and is directed perfectly by Sam Mendes who debuted with American Beauty It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan Tom Hanks who is seen by his son Tyler Hoechlin on one of his jobs Michael s boss John Rooney Paul Newman thinks things will be okay but his jealous son Connor Rooney Daniel Craig sets both his father and Michael up leading to the death of Michael s wife Jennifer Jason Leigh and second son Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit man Harlen Maguire Jude Law to finish the job Since Michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss Frank Nitti Stanley Tucci In a way Road to Perdition is a standard gangster movie but it is so well made you almost can not see that This movie is good in its production design art direction sound music and most of all in its cinematography All these elements are able to surprise and create suspense although the outcome is pretty certain That Hoechlin is not a annoying kid and Hanks Law and Newman know how to act helps of course Based on a comic this movie is so much better than you would expect and although it has it flaws it belongs to the better movies in the genre Sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time The scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help in that area See this movie that will look familiar at times but is totally new on a lot of areas
0	This type of plot really does have a lot of potential but it was butchered here Honestly I sensed the cheese element in the beginning but I thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing Whoa I was wrong So mad scientist makes a monster wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them but of course they escape After that it s really bad I should ve counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage but I most likely would have lost count Pan down to the blood dripping from severed leg to show us how the shark man finds the folks I hate being spoon fed every aspect of a horror film Oh and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark man and trudging around a jungle esqe island there s nothing more cheerful than a middle aged man reciting Shakespeare This is one where you ll find yourself rooting for the monster if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for a flick
1	Hollow Man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist Dr Sebastian Caine Kevin Bacon finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum They test the serum on an already invisible Gorilla it works perfectly Caine his team of assistant s celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers Caine wants to be the first invisible human He manages to persuade his team to help him the procedure works well Caine becomes invisible however when they try to bring him back the serum fails he remain invisible The team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works Caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory But then again he s invisible right he can do anything he wants Directed by Paul Verhoeven I rather liked Hollow Man You know it s just after Christmas I saw this a few hours ago on late night early morning cable TV worst of all I feel sick not because of the film but because of the chocolates fizzy pop I ve had over the past week so I ll keep this one brief The script by Andrew W Marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle has a good central premise it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original The Invisible Man film which Hollow Man obviously owes a fair bit It manages to have a petty successful blend of horror sci fi action provide good entertainment value for odd minutes I thought the character s were OK I thought some of the ideas in the film were good although I think it s generally known that Verhoeven doesn t deal in subtlety the first thing he has the invisible Caine do is sexually molest one of his team then when he gets into the outside world he has Caine rape a woman with the justification who s going to know that Caine says to himself Then of course there s the gore he shows a rat being torn apart that s just the opening scene after the credits to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty sadistic tone about it Having said that I love horror gore exploitation films so Hollow Man delivers for me it s just that it might not be everyone s cup of tea Director Verhoeven does a great job or should that be the special effects boys make him look good The special effects in Hollow Man really are spectacular more or less flawless their brilliant it s as simple straight forward as that There s some good horror action set pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over the top I love the effect where Kevin Bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins organs bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the Gorilla There s a few gory moments including a rat being eaten someone is impaled on a spike someone has their head busted open with blood splattering results With a staggering budget of about Hollow Man is technically faultless I can imagine the interviews on the DVD where some special effects boffin says they mapped Bacon s entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldn t they The acting was OK Bacon made for a good mad scientist anti hero type guy Hollow Man is one of hose big budget Hollwood extravaganzas where the effects action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or character s but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film well I know I do Good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier darker streak than the usual Hollywood product definitely worth a watch
1	IN COLD BLOOD is masterfully directed and adapted by Richard Brooks However it s also so bent on being realistic it s sometimes more clinical than entertaining Recounting the brutal killing of a Midwest family author Truman Capote focused on minutia wrapping himself and the reader up in the subject AND subjects Brooks departs wildly from that approach in favor of something closer to docudrama Although he films on actual locations he keeps his distance The murderers are portrayed as depraved imbeciles which surely they were They re not seen as misunderstood souls as in the Capote book and the savagery of their act is horrifyingly blunt Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are excellent as the killers as is the supporting cast including John Forsythe and Paul Stewart as the reporter the Capote character The landmark photography is by the great Conrad Hall
0	Can I give this a minus rating No Well let me say that this is the most atrocious film I have ever tried to watch It was Painful Boringus Maximus The plot is well hidden in several sub levels of nebulosity I rented this film with a friend and after about thirty minutes of hoping it would get better we decided to fast forward a little to see if things would get any better It never gets better This film about some dude getting kidnapped by these two girls sounds interesting but in reality it is just a bore Nothing even remotely interesting ever happens If you ever get the chance to watch this do yourself a favor try PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE instead
0	I m a big fan of B having caught on only at the end of season three I faithfully watched all the previous seasons when it was syndicated concluding that it was one of the most well thought out story arcs to ever hit television Even the filler episodes were interesting The movies also were well produced and as entertaining as anything to hit the theaters Which brings us to River of Souls Naturally after seeing everything else I had high expectations Martin Sheen appears to be acting in an Ed Wood movie rather than a serious Sci Fi story The story itself might have looked good in outline form even made it to the story board However it suffers obviously when it came time to filling this notion out into a two hour movie There are no special effects to keep us entertained in the total absence of a compelling story There are places where they were obviously short of time and just improvised the dialog to fill the story out Had this made the regular season it would have rated among the worst of the episodes
1	You do not get more dark or tragic than Othello and this movie captures the play fairly well with outstanding performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob Fishburne s expresses to the viewer Othello s torment as he falls prey to Iago s lies very convincingly even providing a realistic epileptic episode Jacob is the loving and loyal wife who becomes either the instrument of Iago s revenge against Othello or the object of his wrath it is not clear which since no motive for Iago s behavior is offered Although Kenneth Brannagh sp displays his usual talent for Shakespeare in this movie he is somewhat marginalized The characters of Cassio and Emilia also wander in and out of scenes even though they like Iago seem more crucial to the plot I have not checked the movie against the play to see how many lines were cut out but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop his characters even the seemingly unimportant ones very well If I had any criticism of the movie it would be that the story unfolds too quickly and that the relationships between some of the characters are not laid out more The director had a great cast and no one offered a bad performance The relationship between Cassio and Othello and that between Emilia and Desdemona need to be further developed earlier in the film I have a feeling that they were closer to each other than the movie suggests although you get a sense of this very late into the movie Also Othello and Desdemona need more time together Although their anguish is convincing the amount of interaction they have with each other makes it seem like they just met On the other hand maybe the did just meet like Romeo and Juliet In brief good performances too short
1	Dudley Moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic This film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent Without Dudley Moore John Gielgud Liza Minnelli and a few others this film could have been a disaster It is not always well shot and at times has some very corny music that tries to force a mood the psycho like music at the wedding fight but the acting overcomes it The character Arthur is hilarious with his drunken comments But he develops well into a more mature well rounded character as he learns to live by his own free will The end is fairly corny though I wont give it away but it could be improved Worth seeing many times
1	A wonderful film filled with great understated performance and sharp intelligent dialogue What really distinguishes the film however is that undercurrent of sadness throughout The story is underscored by affairs loneliness suicide disappointment the fear of losing ones job in a world where that had disastrous consequences Most of all it was set in a world that no longer existed having been ripped apart by the beginning of World War II In fact the film is barely a comedy at all if you compare the percentage of serious scenes to the comic scenes Yet funny it is listen to Margaret Sullivan s harsh dismissal of Jimmy Stewart and watch his pained expression as he replies that her comments were a remarkable blend of poetry and meanness It s funny pointed and sad all at once A remarkable achievement and one of the ten greatest screen comedies ever made
0	Brainless film about a good looking but brainless couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours The pair almost instantly make the wrong choice of customers and get mixed up with some people seeking to recover the items that we see falling to the ocean floor during the opening credits sequence Great looking direct to video movie could have been so much better if it wasn t so interested in primarily looking good Performances are serviceable and the plot is actually not bad or would have been had the director and producers not redirected the plot into making sure we see lots of shapely people in bathing suits or in what I m guessing the reason for the unrated moniker a few fleeting bare breasts The film never generates any tension nor rises above the level of a forgettable TV movie If you get roped in to seeing this you won t pluck your eyes out since the eye candy is pleasant but we really need to stop producers from making films that are excuses to have a paid vacation
1	This is my kind of film I am fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares and this movie is just that But it is also a dark comedy While I see it mostly as a horror thriller there will be others who might see it as a black dramatic comedy But either way it is a fascinating descent into madness The ending caught me off guard but what an ending It leaves the viewer a lot to think about Powerful performances a complex and detailed plot a great script filled with dread and dashes of humor and an eerie atmosphere make this a film worth watching Personally I think that I will need to watch this several more times to pick up and understand all the subtleties that are within But it is such a film that it will be a pleasure and not a chore so to do
1	Diego Armando Maradona was and still remains as the best football player the game has offered Not just an athlete but an artist This documetary if the World Cup will forever live in the memories of every football fan around the world Because of his tremendous and unbelievable goal which he scored against my own country england There s absolutely no point of diminishing this star Although I dont undersand spanish I can appreciate the argentine narrator He actually cries of happiness and can barely express his emotion Anything I wrote can be senseless and difficult to comprehend but readers you have to watch this to know what I mean
0	ba ba ba boring this is next to battlefield earth in science fiction slumberness genie francis aka general hospital s laura has a small role as a reporter and that in itself should tell you that this movie must be bad there is ben kingsley an academy award winning actor in this stinker and a few others decent actors You have to wonder what possessed them to decide to do this awful movie The music dramatically goes up and down like it s a major dramatic story Even if you pay attention the plot is impossible to follow The effects are mediocre as well and seem really dated All of the actors speak in a monotone voice and have no realism to their dialogue I could go on and on on how this is a bad movie At least with Battlefield Earth it s so bad it s funny but this is just b o r i n g Avoid unless you want to be lulled to sleep
0	Probably New Zealands worst Movie ever madeThe Jokes They are not funny Used from other movies just plain corny The acting Is bad even though there is a great castThe story is Uninteresting Boring Has more cheese then pizza huts cheese lovers pizza kind of like the acting Has been do times beforeI watched this when it came on TV but was so boring could only stand minutes of it This movie sucksDo not watch it Watch paint dry instead
0	The various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used If Ms Pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offer Otherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical Canadian movies As other reviewers have pointed out Canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get Perhaps Canadian movie producers are consciously trying to de commercialize their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing movies by definition are a commercial thing
1	I found myself at sixes and sevens while watching this one Altman s touch with zooms in and out were there and I expected those devices to comment on characters and situations Unfortunately as far as I could see they sometimes were gratuitous sometimes witty often barren for failing to point out some ironic or other connection In particular two zoom outs from the gilt dome in savannah merely perplexed To be fair though a few zooms outs and ins to Branagh heightened his character s increasing bewilderment a la Pudgy McCabe s or Philip Marlow s On the whole the zooms were well inconsistent and sometimes even trite Other Almanesque devices such as multiple panes of glass between camera and subject succeeded in suggesting characters sollipsism or narcissism or opaque states of knowledge Car windshields house windows and other screens were used effectively and fairly consistently I felt harking back to THE PLAYER and even THE LONG GOODBYE A few catchy jump cuts especially to a suggestive tv commercial reminded me of such usage in SHORT CUTS to sardonic effect But finally the mismatch between Altman s very personal style and the sheer weight of the Grisham genre momentum failed to excite me This director s s masterpieces revised and deconstructed various classic genres including the chandler detective film which this resembled in some ways this time around the director seemed to have too few arrows in his analytic quiver to strike any meaningful blow to the soft underbelly of this beastly genre Was he muzzled in by mammonist producers perhaps Or am I missing something due to my feeble knowledge of the genre he takes on here Nonetheless the casting was excellent all around Tom Berenger for his terrifying ferality Branagh for his deflated hubris Robert Downey Jr s pheromonal haze Robert Duvall s method of trash and Davidtz s lurking femme fatality were near perfect choices all And except for a few slips out of Georgia into Chicago on the part of brunette Daryl Hannah accents were convincingly southern Suspense and mood were engrossing even if the story didn t quite rivet viewers The moodiness of a coastal pre hurricane barometric plunge was exquisitely painstakingly rendered I felt like yelling at the usher to turn on the swamp cooler pronto Torn in the end I judged it a
0	I am a back Batman movie and TV fan I loved the show new and old and I loved all the movies But this movie is not as great as some people were hopeing it to be In my opinon it is a big let down I think the problem was it had no drama Batman Mask Of The Phantasm and Batman Beyond Return Of The Joker had a lot of drama and Batman Mr Freeze Sub Zero had some drama too Also I think this movie is to light for Batman The only scene that seems a little dark is the big fight with Bane at the end Anyways it s an ok Batman movie But I would just rent it
0	I gave this movie a single star only because it was impossible to give it less Scientists have developed a formula for replicating any organism In their lab a run down warehouse in L A they create a T Rex A group of industrial spies break in to steal the formula and the remainder of the film is one endless foot chase Of course the T Rex a rubber puppet gets loose and commences to wipe out the cast It has the amazing ability to sneak up within or feet of someone without them noticing and then promptly bites their head off One cast member escapes in a police car and spends the remainder of the film driving aimlessly through the city She is of such superior mental ability that she can t even operate the radio She never makes any attempt to drive to a substation or a donut shop and appears hopelessly lost The T Rex wreaks havoc throughout the city there are blazing gun battles and buildings cardboard mock ups blowing up but a single police car or the army nor anyone else ever shows up Such activity must be commonplace in Los Angeles We can only hope that a sequel isn t planned
0	I love Dracula but this movie was a complete disappointment I remember Lee from other Dracula films from when i was younger and i thought he was great but this movie was really bad I don t know if it was my youth that fooled me into believing Lee was the ultimate Dracula with style looks attraction and the evil underneath that Or maybe it was just this film that disappointed me But can you imagine Dracula with an snobbish English accent and the body language to go along with it Do you like when a plot contains unrealistic choices by the characters and is boring and lacks any kind of tension Then this is a movie for you Otherwise don t see it I only gave it a because somehow i managed to stay awake during the whole movie Sorry but if you liked this movie then you must have been sleep deprived and home alone in a dark room with lots of unwatched space behind you Maybe alone in your parents house or in a strangers home Cause not even the characters in this flick seemed afraid and i think that sums up the whole thing Or maybe you like this film because of it s place in Dracula cinema history perhaps being fascinated by how the Dracula story has evolved from Nosferatu to what it is today Cause as movie it isn t that appealing it doesn t pull you in to the suggestive mystery that for me make the Vampyre myth so fascinating And furthermore it has so much of that tacky ies feel about it The scenery looks like cheap Theatre And i don t say that rejecting everything made in the ies Cause i can love old film as well as new
0	I wish I d known more about this movie when I rented it I d put it in my queue on the basis of Heather Graham and her strong cred as an actress IMHO While parts of the movie were charming much of the movie felt contrived undeveloped or otherwise just boring or predictable Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people thinking the sibs were a couple I don t care how big a part of the story line that is it still felt a bit um gross And Charlie for a zoologist she certainly doesn t seem to be very attuned to signals from other Homo sapiens What was it about her besides her hotness and some common interests that made Gray fall for her The story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth High points Molly Shannon although I do agree with the reviewer who found her annoying on occasion the cabbie in drag and the dance sequences if Sam Gray were such great dancers I wish we d seen more of that as the bits we were shown were indeed better than most of the rest of the movie Could have been better
1	The material in this documentary is so powerful that it brought me to tears Yes tears I tell you This popular struggle of a traditionally exploited population should inspire all of us to stand up for our rights put forth the greater good of the community and stop making up cowardly excuses for not challenging the establishment Chavez represents the weak and misfortunate in the same way Bush is the face of dirty corporations and capitalism ran amok Indeed Latin America is being reshaped and the marginalized majority is finally having a voice in over five centuries Though in the case of Mexico the election was clearly stolen by Calderon Chavez is not perfect far from it He s trying to change the constitution to allow him to rule indefinitely That cannot be tolerated Enough with the politics and back to the movie The pace is breath taking at moments and deeply philosophical at others It portrays Chavez as a popular hero unafraid to challenge the US hegemony and domination of the world s resources If you think the author is biased in favour of Chavez nothing s stopping you from doing your homework One crucial message of the film is questioning info sources as was clearly demonstrated by the snippers casualties being shamefully blamed on Chavez s supporters Venezuela puts American alleged democracy to shame Hasta la revolucion siempre
1	A solid B movie I like Jake Weber His understated delivery is refreshing in a time of over the top performances I liked the relationship between the father and son I liked the family dynamics The Wendigo looks silly but it is a representation of the kid s toy and the dead deer It s an amalgamation like see This is a psychological story not a Freddy slash em up instant gratification flick Watch it and reflect on your inner child and what the movie might have to say to you and you ll be fine Nice work
1	A Give this Movie a because it deserves a Two of the best actors of their time Walter Matthau George Burns collaborate with Neil Simon and all of the other actors that are in this film director Herbert Ross and all of that makes this stage adaption come true The Sunshine Boys is one of the best films of the s I love the type of humor in this film it just makes me laugh so hard I got this movie on VHS days ago yes VHS because it was cheaper only I watched it as soon as I got home but I had to watch it again because I kept missing a few parts the first time The second time I watched it it felt a lot better and I laughed a lot harder I m definitely going to re get this on DVD because I HAVE to see the special features It s very funny how that happens Two people work together as entertainers actors performers They get along well on stage but really argue off stage they can t survive another minute with each other then some years later you want to reunite them for a TV special You can find that in this film Matthau Burns were terrific in this film It s a damn shame they died George Burns deserved that Oscar He gave a strong comic performance He was also when this movie was filmed So far he s the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an old age Jessica Tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress Richard Benjamin was also fantastic in this He won a Golden Globe for best supporting actor He deserved that Golden Globe Although many people might disagree with what I am about to say everybody in this film gave a strong performance This Comedy is an instant classic I highly recommend it One more thing Whoever hates this film is a Putz
1	Yesterday my Spanish Catalan wife and myself saw this emotional lesson in history Spain is going into the direction of political confrontation again That is why this masterpiece should be shown in all Spanish High Schools It is a tremendous lesson in the hidden criminality of fascism The American pilot who gets involved in the Spanish Civil War chooses for the democratically elected Republican Government The criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most inventive scenes that Uribe ever made The colors are magnificent The cruelty of a war could anybody tell me the difference between Any war and a Civil war is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other The cowards that start their abuse of power even towards innocent children are now active again A film like El viaje de Carol Carol s journey tells one of the so many sad stories of the th Century It is a better lesson in history than any book could contain Again great work from the Peninsula Iberica
0	While flipping through the channels on a late Saturday night my friends and I stumbled across this film First of all Irish actor Pierce Brosnan as a Native American Seriously His accent was breaking through so much although his character was apparently Scottish Next I was stunned to find that this film was made after he had already played James Bond Agent at least twice This movie plays up the stereotypes with the inspiring professor figure The girl who played Pony should be paid to keep her mouth shut And this film won an award I cannot believe it Brosnan is an attractive man but we seriously wanted to gauge our eyes out after watching this for just seconds We switched from Kicking and Screaming to this and we wanted to switch back We watched the children s classic The Indian in the Cupboard earlier in the night which also discussed the Iroquois The following line represents our desire to run away Take me outside earth grasper From Grey Owl If you don t like it you don t have to watch
1	I saw this movie in when it was first released at the Cameo Theater on South Beach now the famous Crowbar Night club It was the last year of the wild s and this movie really hit home It s got everything the generation gap the sexual revolution the quest for success and the conflict between following one s family traditions to those of seeking ones own way through life It was a fast paced highly enjoyable movie Vegas was at it s hippiest peak Sin City in all it s glory Beautiful women famous cameos laughs conflict romance and even a happy ending A very enjoyable time over all The poster from this film rests on my bedroom wall I look at it and I go back in time a time of my youth and my times with my dad a great time in my life
1	If ever I was asked to remember a song from a film of yester years then it would have to be Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Paar Chalo for its meaning the way it is sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd Rafi the lyrics by Kaif Bhopali and not to mention the cinema photography when the sailing boat goes out against the black background and the shining stars The other would have to be Chalte Chalte Pakeezah was Meena Kumari s last film before she died and the amount of it time it took can be seen on the screen In each of the the songs that are picturised she looks young but after that she does not But one actor who didn t change in his looks was the late Raj Kumar who falls in love with her and especially her feet after he accidentally goes into her train cabin and upon seeing them he leaves a note describing how beautiful they are Conclusion Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story that if at all possible should be viewed on large screen just for the sake of the cinema photography and songs The movie stars the Meena kumari Raj Kumar and Ashok Kumar and is directed by Kamal Amrohi Kamal Amrohi s grandson has now started to revive his grand father s studio by making a comedy movie

0	Americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within the span of a typical commercial we tend to lose interest really fast I found out an exciting fact from this film someone has to paint high tension utility poles and do it on a schedule And guess what they really would like to be doing something else the viewer has similar feelings Surprisingly when I was bored watching late night infomercials and decided to actually watch this film I found the characters to be interesting and highly engaging I just don t usually watch that much late night TV so I can t recommend this film unless watching paint dry is your idea of an exciting two hours out of your life
0	Houseboat Horror is a great title for this film It s absolutely spot on and therefore the only aspect of the film for which I can give out of There are houseboats there is horror there s even horror that takes place on houseboats But if there were ever a tagline for the film poster it would surely be Something shonky this way comes for Houseboat Horror is easily the worst Australian horror film I ve ever seen not to mention one of the worst horror films I ve ever seen and a fairly atrocious attempt at film making in general The good news is it s so bloody awful it sails straight through the zone of viewer contempt into the wonderful world of unintentional hilarity It s worth watching because it s bloody awful The category of worst comes not from the storyline for the simple reason that there actually is one a record producer a film crew and a rock band drive up to the mystifyingly named Lake Infinity a picturesque rural retreat somewhere in Victoria in reality Lake Eildon to shoot a music video Someone isn t especially happy to see them there and possibly in an attempt to do the audience a favour starts picking them off one by one with a very sharp knife Even more mystifying is how long it takes the survivors to actually notice this On the surface it looks like a very bog standard B movie slasher You ve got highly annoying youths intolerant elders creepy locals one of whom a petrol station attendant would easily win a gurning competition and let s face it my description of the murderer could easily be Jason Voorhees Ah but if only the acting and production values were anywhere near as good as the comparative masterpiece that was Friday The th Part VII Unfortunately Houseboat Horror is completely devoid of both these things But in the end this only makes what you do get so ridiculous and amusing Fans of one time Late Show and Get This member Tony Martin will already be aware of some of the real dialogue gems Check out the view you ll bar up while the actual song to accompany the music video is so bad it has to be heard to be believed I can t help wondering if writer director Ollie Wood hoped it would actually become a hit The horror element is comparable I think to B slashers of the genre and particularly of the period but there were times when I couldn t help imagining someone biting into a hamburger off screen and seeing a volley of tomato sauce sprayed at the wall on screen Indeed if you ve been listening to Tony Martin recommending this film as hilarious rubbish like myself I don t think you ll be disappointed Any fans of so bad it s good horror should not pass up the opportunity Whether you ll bar up or not though is another matter If on the other hand you are in search of genuine excellence in the Australian horror genre get yourself a copy of the incomparable Long Weekend and don t look back
1	I was lucky enough to catch this film finally on Turner Classic films tonight as it is one of the films that won an Oscar for special effects in their yearly month of Oscar winning films BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS is easily a sequel film for the earlier success of MARY POPPINS That film too was a big success and an Oscar winner Best Actress for Julie Andrews Like MARY POPPINS BEDKNOBS has David Tomlinson in it in a role wherein he learns about parenting It is a fine mixture of live action and animation It is set in a past period of British history if not the Edwardian Georgian world of London it is England s coastline during the Dunkirk Summer of It even has old Reginald Owen in it here as a General in the Home Guard whereas formerly he was Admiral Boom in MARY POPPINS Ironically it was Owen s final role The Home Guard sequences not too many in the film reminds one of the British series DAD S ARMY dealing with the problems of the local home guard in the early years of the war The period is also well suggested by the appearance of the three Rawlins children as war orphans from the bombings in the Blitz in London And in typical Disney fashion in the musical number Portobello Road different members of the British Army including soldiers from India and the Caribbean complete with metal drums yet appear with Scottish and local female auxiliaries in costume All of which surprisingly is a plus But the biggest plus is that for Angela Lansbury her performance as Eglantine Price is finally it her sole real musical film lead In a noteworthy acting career Lansbury never got the real career musical role she deserved as Auntie Mame in the musical MAME that came out shortly after BEDKNOBS did She had been in singing parts in GASLIGHT with her brief UP IN A BALLOON BOYS and in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY with LITTLE YELLOW BIRD and best of all in support and in conclusion of THE HARVEY GIRLS with the final reprise of ON THE ATCHISON TOPEKA AND THE SANTA FE But only here does she play the female lead So when you hear her singing with David Tomlinson you may be able to understand what we lost when she did not play Mame Dennis Burnside The rest of the cast is pretty good Tomlinson here learning that he can rise to the occasion after a lifetime of relative failure The three children Cindy O Callaghan Roy Snart and Ian Weighill actually showing more interesting sides in their characters than their Edwardian predecessors in POPPINS Weighill in particular as something of a budding opportunist thinking of blackmailing Lansbury after finding out she is a witch The only surprising waste possibly due to cutting of scenes is Roddy McDowall as the local vicar who is only in two sequences of the film With his possible role as a disapproving foe of witchcraft he should have had a bigger part Also of note is John Ericson as the German officer who leads a raid at the conclusion of the film only to find that he is facing something more powerful than he ever imagined in the British countryside and Sam Jaffe as a competitor for the magic formula that Lansbury and Tomlinson are seeking As for the animation the two sequences under the sea in a lagoon and at the wildest soccer match ever drawn are well worth the view with Tomlinson pulled into the latter as the referee and getting pretty badly banged up in various charges and scrimmages As I said it is a pretty fine sample of the Disney studio s best work
1	This movie is one among the very few Indian movies that would never fade away with the passage of time nor would its spell binding appeal ever diminish even as the Indian cinema transforms into the abyss of artificially styled pop culture while drill oriented extras take to enhancing the P T styled film songs The cinematography speaks of the excellent skills of Josef Werching that accentuate the monumental and cinema scope effect of the film in its entirety Gone are the days of great cinema when every scene had to be clipped many times and retakes taken before finalizing it while meticulous attention was paid in crafting and editing the scenes Some of its poignant scenes are filled with sublime emotional intensity like the instance when Meena Kumari refuses to say YES as an approval for Nikah Marriage Bond and climbs down the hill while running berserk in traumatized frenzy At the moment Raj Kumar follows her and a strong gale of wind blew away the veil of Kumari and onto the legs of Kumar Kamal Amrohi shall always be remembered with golden words in the annals of Indian Cinema s history for endeavoring to complete this movie in a record setting years He had to manage filming of some of the vital songs without Meena s close ups because Meena Kumari the lady in the lead role was terminally ill and fighting for her life in early
0	Fly Me To The Moon has to be the worst animated film I ve seen in a LONG TIME That s saying something since I have taken my son to see every animated release for the last years now The story is to be generous trite The voice acting is atrocious Too cute sounding The humor is of the Romper Room variety The animation is passable for a Nickolodeon type of cartoon but this is being released on the big screen not cable television It gets a only because of it s OK D visuals Some of the scenes had a mildly stimulating image but We ve seen much better in the past I also question the insistence of the filmmakers to have characters fly away from the screen rather than into it in most of the scenes While that is interesting at first it became tiresome after the rd or th time It seemed to smack of indifference to me on the part of the creators I will say this though It had a pretty cool soundtrack And for the record my son wasn t too crazy about it either Bad movie
0	Pam Grier stars as Coffy She s a nurse who seeks revenge on the drug dealers who got her sister hooked on bad heroine Like any s Blaxploitation flick you can expect to see the racist bad guys get their just desserts There were scores of these films made during the s and they were really demeaning to both black and white audiences alike This is mainly due to the vicious racial hostility in these films and the degrading stereotypical characters Especially the female characters Other common threads between Coffy and other films of its type include brutal violence corrupt cops car chases a generous abundance of nudity and sex crazed gorgeous women Not to mention urban ghettos populated by drug dealers pimps mobsters and other criminal scum Pam Grier was the undisputed queen of s Blaxploitation heroines She was magnificent being both tough as nails and drop dead gorgeous Like in her other films Pam outshines the other characters in Coffy In fact Pam is so charismatic on screen that these sorts of films are unwatchable without her as the main character If you like Pam Grier you re better off seeing her other films like Foxy Brown or perhaps Friday Foster These films have much less empty sleaze than Coffy does Pam s character in Coffy degrades herself way too much to get the bad guys Pam s characters in her other Blaxploitation films don t stoop as low to get revenge as Coffy did I d say only watch Coffy if you re unable to see any of Pam Grier s other films Otherwise Coffy is a waste of time Only Pam s talent as an actress makes viewing Coffy bearable
1	Although some may call it a Cuban Cinema Paradiso the movie is closer to a How Green Was My Valley a memory film mourning for a lost innocence The film smartly avoids falling into a political trap of taking sides pro Castro anti Castro focusing instead in the human frailty of the characters and the importance of family Filled with good acting in particular from Mexican actress Diana Bracho who plays Keitel s wife A masterpiece filled with references to classic movies from CASABLANCA to Chaplin s CITY LIGHTS Gael Garcia Bernal plays a small role which is critical for the dramatic payoff of the story TV director Georg Stanford Brown in a rare return to acting remember THE ROOKIES plays a homeless bum who acts as Greek chorus superbly It is a pity that this movie originally titled DREAMING OF JULIA has been released in the States by THINKfilm with the atrocious title of CUBAN BLOOD which has nothing to do with the movie
1	The goal of any James Bond game is to make the player feel like he is fulfilling an ultimate fantasy step into the shoes of Agent FRWL comes closer to this goal than any other game because this time you control the real James Bond No offense to Pierce Brosnan who made a fantastic Bond and loaned his voice and likeness to EON but Sean Connery was the original James Bond and there will never be anyone who comes close to his level of cool I must say at this point like many others who have reviewed this game that Sean year old voice doesn t fit his year old image on screen and this takes some getting used to but it s certainly worth it He makes lines like Bond James Bond and Shaken not stirred into a big deal again But controlling Sir Sean as he takes on the evil organization known as OCTOPUS is as Bond said in Octopussy only the tip of the tentacle The awesomeness of the game begins with the opening gun barrel It s the original gun barrel from the movies Then you take on first mission rescuing the Prime Minister s hottie blonde daughter from terrorists at Parliament and everything from the cars to the clothes is perfectly retro The world of the game is truly the world of the original James Bond right down to the classic rock n roll rendition of the James Bond theme that finally plays during a key moment late in the game as Bond infiltrates a secret factory After the game s opening the plot faithfully follows the plot of the movie FRWL James Bond is sent to Turkey to retrieve a Lektor device from a Russian cipher clerk who claims she has a crush on him In Turkey Bond teams up with lovable sidekick Kerim Bey Bond must retrieve the device protect the damsel in distress and get both safely back to London Bond screenwriter Bruce Feirstein worked on the script and he s done a good job of making the game the same but different to the movie The characters from the movie are all recreated well but some are better than others The impersonators voicing villains Rosa Klebb and Red Grant are uncanny And there s a moment early on in the game where you interact with a Miss Moneypenny M and Q who all look and behave as they did in the original Sean Connery movies What puts this game miles ahead of the other Bond games besides Sir Sean s voice and likeness is two notable features in the game play One is Bond focus While you can dispatch villains simply by locking onto them with one button and killing them with the other an additional button push will allow you to zoom in closer on a target and choose between spots Bond would shoot at such as a grenade attached to a belt that will dispatch an enemy and a few of his friend or a rappel cord that will cause a suspended enemy to plunge to his death The other notable feature is the stealth and m l e kills When you re in close enough range just hit a button to beat down an enemy with the raw brutality that only Sean Connery s James Bond displayed Sean Connery s Bond relied mostly on his raw wit and talent so you only have a few gadgets but they re good ones The Q copter is a remote control helicopter that can self destruct and explore areas Bond can t reach like the Q spider in EON only better The classic laser watch is useful not just for getting into sealed rooms but dispatching enemies when you have no other weapon available Sonic cuff links and a serum gun are the most fun to play around with but you must experience them for yourself Besides the gadgets you can go dress Bond up in a number of retro costumes found during the game including the gray suit from the movie the standard black tuxedo a retro stealth suit and that classic white tuxedo all which look exactly like they did when Sir Sean wore them in the movies When you drive in the game you drive the Aston Martin DB straight out of Goldfinger It can t turn invisible but it has a gadget for popping tires like in the movie And when you re not flying down the streets of Istanbul in the Goldinger car you can fly through the air in the Thunderball jet pack Then there s the multi player Of course it has to be compared to the standard of the GoldenEye game and it fails Also you can only play Bond villains rather than Bond himself or the other heroes of the game But the multi player is amusing and a decent bonus since the awesomeness of the single player campaign alone makes the game worth playing The basic game does have other flaws Some of the movie s most exciting moments particularly the gypsy camp shootout Bond s brawl with Red Grant on the Orient Express and a confrontation between Bond and Rosa Klebb s bladed shoe aren t done justice in game form And the game is a fast play even on the hardest difficulty But overall this game is the best James Bond experience so far
1	I haven t seen this in over yrs but I still remember things about it This film could NOT have been made in color The stark grays are what make it and was life really that simple in the s What stands out the most in my memory is Perry Smith going to the gallows His breathing under the hood just before they sprung the trap I don t think I could watch that again once is plenty It s like that unnamed guy at the beginning of Papillon who is dragged out in terror to the guillotine The guy that said watch this on a double bill with Dead Man Walking should have added the last minutes of I Want To Live as well Some of my ancestors being aristos went to the guillotine in so my feelings on the death penalty are rather intense
0	I m probably not giving this movie a fair shake as I was unable to watch all of it Perhaps if I d seen it in a theater in its original presentation I might have appreciated it but it s far too slow moving for me I read the book some years ago and the details of the plot have faded from memory This did not help the film as it s something less than vivid and clear in its presentation of events This is really four linked films or a film in four parts and was I believe intended to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation I found Part I to be enjoyable enough but it was all I could do to sit through Part II which drags interminably Reading Tolstoy s philosophizing is one thing If you get a good translation or can read it in the original his brilliant writing far outweighs any issues one might have with the pace of the story On film however it s hard to reproduce without being ponderous I have other issues with the parts of the film that I saw It s very splashy with a lot of hey ma look at this camera work that calls attention to itself instead of serving to advance the story Clearly I m missing something but I just couldn t summon the enthusiasm to crank up parts III and IV
0	A dreary and pointless bit of fluff bloody fluff but fluff Badly scripted with inane and wooden dialogue You do not care if the characters indeed even if the actors themselves live or die Little grace or charm little action little point to the whole thing Perhaps some of the set and setting will interest those gaps between the boards of all the buildings may be true to the way life was lived The framework encounter is unnecessary and distracting and the Hoppalong Cassidy character himself is both boring and inept
1	The Drug Years actually suffers from one of those aspects to mini series or other kinds of TV documentaries run over and over again for a couple of weeks on TV It s actually not long enough in a way All of the major bases in the decades are covered and they re all interesting to note as views into post modern history and from different sides But it almost doesn t cover enough or at least what is covered at times is given a once over when it could deserve more time For example the information and detail in part three about the whole process and business unto itself of shipping mass amounts of drugs partly the marijuana later cocaine is really well presented but there are more details that are kept at behest of how much time there is to cover Overall though the documentary does shed enough light on how drugs pop culture government intervention the upper classes and lower classes and into suburbia all felt the wave of various drugs over the years and the interplay between all was very evident Nobody in the film except for the possibility of small hints with the pot goes to endorse drugs outright but what is shown are those in archival clips about the honesty of what is at times fun and then tragic about taking certain drugs The appearances of various staunch ridiculously anti drug officials does hammer some points down hard with even in such an overview of the drug cultures and America s connection as a whole as there is really only one major point that is made a couple of times by one of the interviewees The only way to really approach the issue of drugs is not just say no because as the war on drugs has shown it is not as effective as thought It is really just to come clean on all sides about all the drugs and the people who may be hypocritical about them as for example oxycontin continues on in the marketplace Is it with the great interest and depth of a Ken Burns documentary No but for some summertime TV viewing for the young i e my age who will view a lot of this as almost ancient history despite most of it being no more than a generation ago as well as for the old who can reflect some decades later about the great peaks careless times and then the disillusionment prodded more by the same media that years earlier propagated and advertised it There are those who might find the documentary to be particularly biased which is not totally untrue but it does attempt to get enough different takes on the social political and entertainment conditions of drugs interweaving for better or obvious worse for enough of a fascinating view

1	it s a very nice movie and i would definitely recommend it to everyone but there are minus points the level of the stories has a large spectrum some of the scenes are very great and some are just boring a lot of stories are not self contained if you compare to f e coffee and cigarettes where each story has a point a message a punchline or however you wanna call it but well most stories are really good some are great and overall it s one of the best movies this year for sure annoying that i have to fill lines at minimum i haven t got more to say and i don t want to start analyzing the single sequences well i think that s it
1	A long defunct prison shut down for over years is re opened and Ethan Sharpe the late great character actor Lane Smith once a guard there is put in place as warden As the prisoners are put to work fixing the place up they re instructed to break into the old execution room This unleashes a fierce spirit that wreaks merciless havoc upon both guards and prisoners cool as can be low key prisoner Burke Viggo Mortensen showing real poise in an early role is thrust into the role of hero I know it s a no brainer to praise the film for its atmosphere it was shot in an actual abandoned penitentiary near Rawlins Wyoming but it elevates this horror film to a higher level It s got a great sense of foreboding established right at the outset Director Renny Harlin made his fourth directorial effort here it got him the Nightmare on Elm Street directing gig and effectively began an impressive career in mainstream action movies thrillers and horror films It may have stock characters but it s got a capable cast bringing them to life Chelsea Field as the young woman vying for prison reform Lincoln Kilpatrick as weary veteran convict Cresus Tom Everett as restless con Rabbitt Ivan Kane as the outgoing Lasagna Tommy Tiny Lister as soft spoken giant Tiny and Arlen Dean Snyder as Captain Horton It s also worth noting as an early acting credit for Kane Hodder as the vengeful spirit that helped him land the gig of playing Jason Voorhees in the Friday the th series Decent special effects moody lighting courtesy of prolific genre cinematographer Mac Ahlberg spooky music by Richard Band and Christopher Stone great visuals the incredibly gloomy location and an overall flashy and intense presentation help to make it quite entertaining It s nasty gruesome and good fun for a horror fan
1	Peter Jacksons version s are better films overall from objective point of view That being said they are not my favorite screen versions of Lord Of The Rings and let me explain why Firstly the acting of the on screen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with Jackson s LOTR The whole cast is too run of the mill Are you claiming that those silly cartoon characters of Ralph Bakshi version are better actors than real people one could ask Well they are not really silly save for Hobbits later about them and they certainly pack more personality than Jackson s party even with much more limited dialogue time And that is because of superior voice acting of the Bakshi s LOTR Take Aragorn for example In this version his voice is deep and charismatic with full of authority Aragorn the lord and with a seasoned rasp Aragorn the ranger This is due to John Hurt s brilliant voice acting Compare that to Viggo Mortensen s rather high pitched sound with no soul and the duel gets quickly uneven Hurt beats Mortensen hands down And then there is Gandalf Probably the most dominating and the most popular character in the whole saga In this Bakshi version Gandalf William Squire is a real wizard And by that I don t mean he shoots bolts from his fingertips he does not but his presence is just captivating He is a mystical powerful and can switch from gentle old man to a scary person with ease Add to that his looks Tall old as the ancient oak beard long as his body sharp eyes wizardy hook nose and of course the classical wizard hat A Perfect Gandalf just like in the books Ian McKellen s Gandalf in the other hand is simply just too boring He looks too human sounds too human acts too human and wears no hat or wields no sword Yes a sword In this Bakshi version Gandalf scores couple of bloody orc kills with his sword as he did in the books And those are stylish slow motion kills Gandalf is not a power to be messed with And it must be noted that while I m sad to say this the great Christopher Lee didn t bring Saruman alive Fraser Kerr in this movie did even with a very limited screen time and lines Before I move completely to visual aspects of the movie it must be mentioned that the voice acting and the general presenation of the Orcs are also superior to Jackson s pretendeous bad guys Bakshi s orcs taunt their enemies or each other constantly with growls screams and nasty language They are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion And finally the Black Riders or the Nazgul Those ultimate bad guys are scary ghosts in this one not just some riders wearing black And they speak with haunting voice which mesmerizes their victim My favorite scene in the film is when the Nazgul are chasing Frodo near the river While Peter Jackson couldn t do anything but show the riders simply chasing the party Bakshi throws in a nightmarish dream with some cool slow motion scenes and thundering sky But as much I like this film more than Jackson s the latter are if only technically still better And that is because of some key visuals As you know Bakshi LOTR features a mixture of animated characters all hobbits and the main cast and real actors covered with paint I don t really have a problem using real people in animation this way but they just don t fit very well with traditional cartoon figures This is especially true with humans Riders of Rohan tavern people etc Orcs are different matter since they are meant to look very distinctive from other characters Orcs while played by humans with animation mix look far superior to Jacksons version They have brownish green skin shiny red eyes flat face and pointed teeth Biggest screw up in this films visuals howerver are the Hobbits While I prefer almost every character in Bakshi version compared to Jackson the latter has clearly superior Hobbits in fact they are perfect With Bakshi you get some irritating and rather poorly drawn humanoid Disney bambies And you are forced to spend a lot of movie time with them so be warned Again the voice acting is OK with them too but the actors mouths cannot save the immersion damage made by these little weasels Well I never really liked those halflings anyway General failures in the Bakshi script are well known Limited playing time with limited budget and a lot of missing scenes So while this film covers nearly half of the story it doesn t do it in extensive detail compared to Jackson s version In a summary the Ralph Bakshi version of LOTR has a superior overall atmosphere it feels more like Middle Earth overall voice acting music I really dig the fantasy score by Kont Rosenman Gandalf Aragorn One of the John Hurt s finest roles King Theoden Orcs Black Riders Elrond He s not some fairy hippie in this one While Jackson version is better because it covers the whole story overall visuals and special effects Gollum Smeagol Balrog HobbitsLord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi even with it s well known shortcomings is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of Tolkien s fantasy world very well if not perfectly I ll give it a score of out of
0	The film had some likable aspects Perhaps too many for my taste It felt as though the writer director was desperately trying to get us to feel the inner conflict of ALL of its characters Not once a few times but all of the time This is the job of television not cinema The location of the train station was well chosen and I enjoyed Sascha Horler s performance as the pregnant friend I felt as though Justine Clarke s performance was wan Her reactions to things felt forced as though the director were trying to vocalise the themes of the film through her protagonist s expressions I also can t believe that a director can make the wonderful Daniela Farinacci into an unbelievable presence I cannot understand the choice of pop music slapped over entire sequences This is a lazy device especially where the pop music comes from no place diagetic to the film and or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly earnest That said there is a breezy quality about the film that evokes the Australian heat and local attitude with originality It does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine Especially with the usage of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity infusing it with passion and hand crafted charm I am curious why the dialogue feels so overworked Who knows if there s a god Like some guy sitting there up in the sky telling us what to do or whatever the line was Perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare to his wife I m giving up smoking An anti smoking commercial A TAC ad with some tasteful animation I had to leave the cinema at the minute mark it was all too much
0	I ve been a fan of all things Bill Maher for years but this film was disappointing and at times disgusting Of course I am Catholic come from a well educated family and go to church of my own volition which probably puts me at ends with quite a few of Bill s opinions Bill s problem is that he presumes that religion is uniformly negative He s correct to document the sociological aspects of it i e one faith builds its holidays on top of another and that many wars have been started because of religion or more accurately by the sinister appeals of men to the ultimate and unquestionable authority of God but that said he never looks at its positive side Quite frankly I think that hell would freeze over before Bill would ever humble himself and travel to the slums of Calcutta where Mother Theresa spent her life working with the poorest of the poor She s dead now of course but he could easily visit the Jesuit priest in East LA who runs Homeboy Industries which works with young men typically with gang and prison backgrounds to teach them career skills get their tattoos removed and to become responsible members of society or he could visit USC s Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies which has brought together some of the world s finest theologians diplomats and investment bankers to study ways in which to ethically integrate the world s poorest countries into global capital markets and thereby improve the standard of living for the half of the world s people who live on less than a day Of course he won t do that because that would require him to consider evidence that does not easily fit into his preconceived beliefs about religion and it s so much easier to continue to make snide superficial jokes That fits into the other large problem with Bill s movie which is that he never subjects himself to anyone either on his level or who is better than he is In this movie you have Maher the Cornell grad spend most of his time talking down to truck drivers at a nondenominational Christian truck stop service in a night club with a Dutch guy who smokes pot all the time with the minister of a storefront church in Miami who claims to be the reincarnation of Christ and with an actor playing Jesus at a Holy Land theme park What you won t see in Bill s film beyond some superficial speculation alongside a Ph D in Grand Central Station that religion chemically alters the brain like drugs do and that religion is the fallacy of tradition wrought on the masses is any sort of serious and questioning interviews with philosophy and theology professors from schools like Notre Dame BYU or Wheaton College who could easily rhetorically decapitate him in a debate on the matter You won t see any serious discussion of any of the writings of C S Lewis G K Chesterton or any papal encyclicals and of course you also won t find any discussion whatsoever of any of the non Abrahamic Judaism Christianity and Islam faiths whatsoever All you get at the end of the day is a textbook example of a condescending snobby elitist from the west side of LA who makes a movie for his own kind and who has absolutely no gut level understanding whatsoever of how the other half of America that elected George W Bush twice lives their lives or about the school of thought behind it I get a lot of what Bill s saying but for someone possessing his intellect and influence this film was nothing less than pathetic Anyone interested in the kind of intellectual ferment that indie documentaries typically bring could find more stimulation in an old rerun of the Teletubbies
1	This one is considered a key Pre Code film from the director who later made the musical biopic THE JOLSON STORY but also the paranoid sci fi INVASION U S A and features one of Barbara Stanwyck s best early roles She s supported by a fine cast which includes popular actors and valued character performers of the day George Brent Douglass Dumbrille Edward van Sloan Nat Pendleton and John Wayne at one point addressing Stanwyck with the titular nickname derived from a popular song which is heard constantly throughout in the former category and in the latter Robert Barrat as Stanwyck s father Donald Cook as her most tragic conquest Alphonse Ethier as her elderly mentor more on this later Arthur Hohl as a lecherous politician and Henry Kolker as Cook s boss and father in law whom Stanwyck also seduces Curiously scenes in which Walter Brennan appeared were subsequently deleted at his own request when the film ran into trouble with the censors Abetted by crackling i e typically hard boiled dialogue and realistic Anton Grot sets the narrative contains unexpected overtones of Nietzschean philosophy fed to our small town heroine by the intellectual Ethier Stanwyck complains to him early on that she s no ball of fire which of course contradicts her later comedy directed by Howard Hawks and co starring Gary Cooper of that name Under Ethier s auspices she quickly blooms into an essentially heartless character determined that nothing shall stand in her path to success the symbolic depiction of her rise in stature at the New York firm she s eventually employed with is reminiscent of a similarly sardonic one relating to an ambitious statesman s lust for power in Sergei Eisenstein s October Sociologically it s also interesting that Stanwyck is constantly seen sticking her neck out for her black maid companion The first two thirds of the film are simply terrific at first I found the latter stages somewhat disappointing because I was expecting to see Stanwyck get her comeuppance by falling for the belatedly introduced George Brent character while he ignores her but just like the others he s soon under her spell On second viewing however this aspect felt less jarring as it s evident that Stanwyck has been affected by the two deaths her selfish behavior has caused and that her tenure in Paris has softened her even if she tries to cling to her hard earned wealth for as long as it s possible Released on DVD by Warners as part of their FORBIDDEN Hollywood VOLUME COLLECTION the film is presented in two strikingly different edits a recently unearthed Pre Release version and the tamer Theatrical Release print Among the considerable footage cut from the latter is dialogue pertaining to Stanwyck s life as a tramp from the age of though it s heard in the accompanying trailer while many other scenes have been shortened i e censored for content the violent fisticuff which develops between Stanwyck and Hohl after she resists his advances the seduction at the railroad car the scene in which Dumbrille is surprised with Stanwyck by Cook the shooting followed by a suicide only shots are heard in the shorter version Stanwyck thinking about her conquests while the phonograph is playing again only Brent appears in the version released to theaters etc Tha latter then utilizes alternate takes for some scenes and includes an establishing shot of the city which is missing from the longer version however we also get an obviously tacked on happy ending the Pre Release version concludes abruptly on a very effective open ended note and an equally unconvincing cautionary letter sent by Ethier to Stanwyck in New York which basically has the function of substituting all references to Nietzsche
1	If you as I have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about Herg and his life creating Tintin I ts so brilliant and a very cool production The whole background story about Herg and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by for good and worse is amazing There is a very fine and obvious connection between the comic books and just this I will for sure be in my basement digging up the Tintin albums again Also the movie itself are very well told and has a great ambient sound to it I really do hope people will find this as intriguing as I did

0	Hopelessly inept and dull movie in which the characters stand around in rooms or a rocket ship and talk endlessly You might think things would perk up when they explore Mars but these scenes are filmed through a heavy red orange filter which makes everything very murky The Martian landscape vegetation consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are entirely unconvincing There are echoes of Bride Of The Monster when the heroine carefully winds the octopus like tentacle of a flesh eating plant around her before weakly thrashing about the difference being that the Ed Wood film is a hundred times more entertaining Better wear earplugs when watching otherwise the sci fi music score repeated endlessly will drive you insane If you find yourself unable to sleep one night just slip this one into the VCR and your insomnia will be cured in no time
1	My dog recently passed away and this was a movie I loved as a kid so I had to see it to try to cheer up Beware of Dog I mean Spoilers This movie isn t just for kids and it s far from ordinary It was set in New Orleans in First and foremost the dog was not portrayed as an extra family member in this film but as an adult with his own complicated life to deal with In the beginning Charlie is not too different from his dishonest and brutal business partner Carface He is money driven greedy and just escaped death row as he states in the start of the feature The difference between Charlie and Carface is that Charlie can learn and is willing to listen to others Anne Marie and his sidekick Itchy Carface will not even listen to the fat ugly dog with the big glasses who happens to be closest to him Carface attempts to murder the hero because he wants of the profits in their business and won t settle for only a highly unusual way for a German Shepherd mix to die Also being eaten by a prehistoric sized alligator who ends up sparing your life because you can sing is highly unlikely whether you are a dog or not This is a cartoon and that s why it is logical here Carface s method of revenge is through murder while Charlie believes success is the best revenge financial success that is After surviving death he starts a business by taking Carface s source of financing a highly talented girl who possesses the ability to communicate with animals They win a whole bunch of races and Charlie tells her he ll give the money to the poor hint hint Charlie and Itchy live in a junkyard and are therefore poor He uses the money toward his casino bar theatre and not the other poor The reason why Anne Marie has the ability to talk to animals is that she has compassion and she listens carefully She teaches Charlie ethics by pointing out his gambling lying and stealing Charlie tries to make up for it by buying her dresses She added the ethics that his business needed while Charlie did management and Itchy provided construction Carface uses violence and property damage to tear down Charlie s business which is unprotected by the government Charlie loses everything and all he has left is this little girl In the end he had to choose between her life and his own He first grabs the watch out of self preservation and sets it down when the girl started to sink Both the girl and the watch were sinking and he had to choose which one and he chose the girl The great part about this movie that focuses on a person s ability to learn right from wrong over time and a child s ability to cope with the natural occurrence of death of their pet is that it never shows anyone dying The watch symbolizes his life and the watch is shown being submerged and stopped All the deaths were suggestive even for the villain I didn t cry during this movie until now and I have gotten so much more out of it that I had to write it down and share it with you
0	Do not bother to waste your money on this movie Do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movie if any others do not appeal to you If you must see a movie this weekend go see Batman again The script was horrible Perfectly written from the random horror movie format Given a place in confined spaces a madman with various weapons a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together and an innocent and overly curious yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend Mix together add much poorly executed gore and what the hell let s put some freaks in there for a little spin to the plot The acting was horrible and the characters unbelievable Borat was more believable than this Spoiler and can someone please tell me how a butcher s vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch I m in the army We need that kind of stuff for ourselves out of and I would place it in the decimals of that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score I can
0	The story behind this movie is very interesting and in general the plot is not so bad but the details writing directing continuity pacing action sequences stunts and use of CG all cheapen and spoil the film First off action sequences They are all quite unexciting Most consist of someone standing up and getting shot making no attempt to run fight dodge or whatever even though they have all the time in the world The sequences just seem bland for something made in The CG features very nicely rendered and animated effects but they come off looking cheap because of how they are used Pacing everything happens too quickly For example Elle is trained to fight in a couple of hours and from the start can do back flips etc Why is she so acrobatic None of this is explained in the movie As Lilith she wouldn t have needed to be able to do back flips maybe she couldn t since she had wings Also we have sequences like a woman getting run over by a car and getting up and just wandering off into a deserted room with a sink and mirror and then stabbing herself in the throat all for no apparent reason and without any of the spectators really caring that she just got hit by a car and then felt the secondary effects of another exploding car Are you okay asks the driver yes I m fine she says bloodied and disheveled I watched it all though because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting but in the end the poor execution made me wish for anything else Blade Vampire Hunter D even that movie with vampires where Jackie Chan was comic relief because they managed to suspend my disbelief but this just made me want to shake the director awake and give the writer a good talking to
1	The effects of job related stress and the pressures born of a moral dilemma that pits conscience against the obligations of a family business albeit a unique one all brought to a head by or perhaps the catalyst of a midlife crisis are examined in the dark and absorbing drama Panic written and directed by Henry Bromell and starring William H Macy and Donald Sutherland It s a telling look at how indecision and denial can bring about the internal strife and misery that ultimately leads to apathy and that moment of truth when the conflict must of necessity at last be resolved Alex Macy is tired he has a loving wife Martha Tracey Ullman a precocious six year old son Sammy David Dorfman a mail order business he runs out of the house as well as his main source of income the family business he shares with his father Michael Sutherland and his mother Deidre Barbara Bain But he s empty years of plying this particular trade have left him numb and detached putting him in a mental state that has driven him to see a psychologist Dr Josh Parks John Ritter And to make matters worse or maybe better depending upon perspective in Dr Parks waiting room he meets a young woman Sarah Cassidy Neve Campbell whose presence alone makes him feel alive for the first time since he can remember She quickly becomes another brick in the wall of the moral conflict his job has visited upon him as in the days after their meeting he simply cannot stop thinking about her His whole life it seems has become a situation one from which he is seemingly unable to successfully extirpate himself without hurting the ones he loves He can deny his age and the fact that he has indeed slipped into a genuine midlife crisis but he is about to discover that the problems he is facing are simply not going to go away on their own He s at a crossroads and he s going to have to decide which way to go And he s going to have to do it very soon From a concept that is intrinsically interesting Bromell has fashioned an engrossing character study that is insightful and incisive and he presents it is a way that allows for moments of reflection that enable the audience to empathize and understand what Alex is going through He makes it very clear that there are no simple answers that in real life there is no easy way out His characters are well defined and very real people who represent the diversity found in life and moreover within any given family unit The film resoundingly implies that the sins of the father are irrefutably passed on to the progeny with irrevocable consequences and effects When you re growing up you accept your personal environment as being that of the world at large and often it is years into adulthood that one may begin to realize and understand that there are actually moral parameters established by every individual who walks upon the planet and that the ones set by the father may not be conducive to the tenets of the son And it is at that point that Alex finds himself as the story unfolds ergo the midlife crisis or more specifically the crisis of conscience from which he cannot escape It s a powerful message succinctly and subtly conveyed by Bromell with the help of some outstanding performances from his actors For some time William H Macy has been one of the premiere character actors in the business creating such diverse characters as Quiz Kid Donnie Smith in Magnolia The Shoveler in Mystery Men and Jerry Lundegaard in Fargo And that s just a sampling of his many achievements At one point in this film Sarah mentions Alex s sad eyes and it s a very telling comment as therein lies the strength of Macy s performance here his ability to convey very real emotion in an understated believable way that expresses all of the inner turmoil he is experiencing Consider the scene in which he is lying awake in bed staring off into the darkness in that one restless moment it is clear that he is grappling not only with his immediate situation but with everything in his life that has brought him finally to this point In that scene you find the sum total of a life of guilt confusion and uncertainty all of which have been successfully suppressed until now all the things that have always been at the core of Alex s life only now gradually breaking through his defense mechanisms and finally surfacing demanding confrontation and resolution It s a complex character created and delivered by Macy with an absolute precision that makes Alex truly memorable It s a character to whom anyone who has ever faced a situation of seemingly insurmountable odds will be able to relate It s a terrific piece of work by one of the finest actors around Sutherland is extremely effective as well his Michael is despicably sinister in a way that is so real it s chilling It s frightening in fact to consider that there are such people actually walking the earth This is not some pulp fiction or James Bond type villain but a true personification of evil hiding behind an outward appearance that is so normal he could be the guy next door which is what makes it all the more disconcerting And Sutherland brings it all to life brilliantly with a great performance Neve Campbell looks the part of Sarah but her performance as is the usual case with her seems somewhat pretentious although her affected demeanor here just happens to fit the character and is actually a positive aspect of the film If only she would occasionally turn her energies inward it would make a tremendous difference in the way she presents her characters Panic however is one of her best efforts a powerful film that in the end is a journey well worth taking
0	The Perfectly Stupid Weapon I think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of Steven Segal s movies was intented to mock Jeff doing his forms to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie The plot is predictable the fights were fair and Jeff acts about as well as the sofa he beats with some sort of weapon in one scene
1	Flynn known mostly for his swashbuckling roles and his bedroom antics takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully Playing real life boxing champ Jim Corbett Flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled San Francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist all the while setting one eye on society deb Smith He and best pal Carson attend an illegal bare knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men and a dog including a prominent judge The next day he gets a chance via Smith to gain entrance to the judge s private club He uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the club s resident boxer His unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers up to and including the world champion John L Sullivan Bond Flynn is downright magical here He is the epitome of charm charisma and appeal in this role He looks terrific especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit and does virtually all of his own stuntwork impressively His line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally Smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for Flynn At this stage he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time and she does so admirably She is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell Bond is incredibly burly brawny and towering yet tender when the script calls for it Amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient Carson Frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as Flynn s manager The rest of the cast is excellent as well including Flynn s rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy Nob Hill types The whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed A few of the sets are amazingly presented Some of Smith s gowns border on the garish but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well It s a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing but it s also so much more Some of it like the character traits shown by Flynn is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes but a lot of it is authentic like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes One line is particularly memorable I believe you like me more than I like you but it s entirely possible that I love you more than you love me It s classic romantic dialogue and there are more than a few zingers sprinkled throughout the script as well
1	Domestic Import was a great movie I laughed the whole time It was funny on so many levels from the crazy outfits to the hilarious situations The acting was great Alla Korot Larry Dorf Howard Hesseman and all the others did an awesome job Because it is an independent film written by a first time writer it doesn t have the clich s that are expected of other comedies which was such a relief It was a unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heart warming story I heard it was based on a true story If so then that is hilarious and amazing I highly recommend this movie
0	WARNING Don t even consider watching this film in any form It s not even worth downloading from the internet Every bit of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid The so called filmmakers apparently have absolutely no idea how to make a film They couldn t tell a good joke to save their lives It s an insult to any human being If you re looking for a fun filled movie go look somewhere else Let s hope this Mr Unterwaldt the Jr being a good indication for his obvious inexperience and intellectual infancy dies a slow painful death and NEVER makes a film again In fact it s even a waste of time to WRITE ANYTHING about this crap that s why I ll stop right now and rather watch a good film
1	I really enjoyed this movie I am a single dad with a year old daughter who is smart athletic and talented I WISH my girl applied herself so well to solving crimes and helping others So for me perhaps this is PG level Fantasyland I read many Nancy Drew books in my teen years long long ago Sure THIS character was ably played by Emma Roberts but did NOT resemble the Nancy Drew I recall from the books That is due to script not the acting Emma is an adorable teen playing a self confident industrious and proud character with good manners and good taste She is not caught up in the trendy competitiveness around her There are some weaknesses in the Plot aside from not resembling the Nancy Drew of the Books and trying to figure out what decade we re in like what is that CAR Anyway I read the IMDb overview before seeing the film as I was researching Rachael Leigh Cook from other movies This is not one of Her best roles but I will continue looking for more of her films Rachael was too old to play this lead but does a fine job as the grown up orphan central to the mystery I am very disappointed in other reviews written here Some expect perfect connection with the books some expect more credible situations or adult action film I got what I expected Good entertainment well targeted to young teen girls And their Fathers who want good kids with high standards of conduct and achievement This is a Teen PG Movie not James Bond Which would YOU Want for a Role Model for YOUR Teenaged Daughter
0	I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo Finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie not just a bit part made me happy Unfortunately I took film appreciation in college and the only thing I can say that I didn t like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos I have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired but Arnold is an excellent actor I have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired I love Arnold Vosloo and he made the film viewable Otherwise I would have written it off as another lousy film I found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good But the sound effects of the shoot out were pretty bad There are some glitches in the film continuity but they are overlookable considering the low caliber of the film All in all I enjoyed the film because Arnold Vosloo was in it Jackie
0	please don t rent or even think about buying this movie they don t even have it available at the red box to rent which would cost a i think its worth less than that the main reason why i rented this d movie was because Jenna Jameson is in the movie lol between min i will give credit that the movie had hot chicks and quite a bit of nudity but other than that you might as well buy another d horror movie that has the same thing with nobody you know Ginger Lynn has more acting time in this movie than Jenna she s not even on the front cover of the movie nor her name i recommend people to watch zombie strippers because you see Jenna almost throughout the whole movie nude most of the time this movie is a big disappointment such a huge waste of time
1	This story was probably one of the most powerful I have ever taken in John Singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece Brilliant performances by the whole cast but Epps and Rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young star s career However as a college student myself many of the issues that Singleton touched on were taken to the extreme In a sense that while they are issues faced on many college campuses they aren t presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe In some instances it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur However aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic the film was brilliant and left me stunned unable to talk just think One of the things from this picture I will remember forever was a quote from Lawrence Fishburn s character Knowledge is power without knowledge you cannot see your power Brilliant just brilliant
1	Film noir is an overused expression when it comes to describing films Every crime drama seems to be a noir But Where the Sidewalk Ends really is a good example of what the genre is all about Very briefly an overzealous detective Andrews accidentally kills a no goodnik who works for the mobsters The killing is blamed on the father Tom Tully of a woman Andrews meets and falls for Tierney To save Dad from Old Sparky Andrews captures the rest of the mob and turns himself in The morally guilty cop is driven by impulses from the past His father was a thief who was killed trying to shoot his way out of jail But that doesn t excuse his actions after he accidentally offs the no goodnik in self defense He immediately goes to the phone to report the incident but he hesitates He s already in hot water with the department and this could finish his career Then at just the wrong moment the phone rings It s Andrews partner and Andrews tells him the suspect they re trailing isn t at home He hides the body and later disposes of it by slugging a watchman and dumping the body in the river What motivates a guy to do something so dumb Okay His job was at risk But now he s committed multiple felonies At least I think they must be multiple I counted obstruction of justice assault disposing of a body without a permit littering first degree mopery and bearing false witness against his neighbor In the end we don t know whether to root for Andrews or not The suspect didn t deserve to die true but it was after all an accident because Andrews didn t know he was a war hero and had a silver plate in his head Maybe it s that kind of ambiguity that made noir what it was among other things such as characteristic lighting If noir involved nothing more than black and white photography murder criminals mystery and suspicious women then we d have to include all the Charlie Chan movies under that rubric Andrews is pretty good He s a kind of Mark MacPherson from Laura gone bitter He never laughs and rarely smiles even when seated across a restaurant table from Gene Tierney a situation likely to prompt smiles in many men He has no sense of humor at all His few wisecracks are put downs When he shoves a stoolie into a cab and the stoolie says Careful I almost hit my head Andrews riposte is That s okay The cab s insured Andrews could seem kind of wooden at times but this is a role that calls for stubborn and humorless determination and he handles it well His underplaying is perfect for the part Little twitches or blinks project his thoughts and emotional states And I guess the director Otto Preminger stopped him from pronouncing bullet as BOO let and police as POE lice Never could make up my mind about Gene Tierney She does alright in the role of Tom Tully s daughter a model but she s like Marilyn Monroe in that you can t separate the adopted mannerisms from the real personality traits Did Tierney actually have such an innocent almost saintly persona When she answered the phone at home did her voice have the same sing along quality that it has on screen Poor Tierney went through some bad psychiatric stuff before there were any effective meds for bipolar disorder And Andrews too nice guy though he appears to have been slipped into alcoholism before finally recovering and making public service announcements The DVD commentary by Peter Muller is unpretentious informed and sometimes amusing Anyway this is a good film as well as a good example of film noir The good guys aren t all good although the bad guys are all bad Maybe that ambiguity is what makes it an adult picture instead of a popcorn movie For the kiddies only one shot is fired on screen and nobody s head explodes Sorry
1	This was the worst movie I ve ever seen yet it was also the best movie Sci Fi original movie s are supposed to be bad that s what makes them fun The line I like my dinosaur meat well done is probably the best quote ever Also the plot sounds like something out of a pot induced dream I can imagine it now the writers waking up after a long night of getting high and playing dance dance revolution then putting ideas together for this Space marines got to alien planet which is infested with dinosaurs and has medieval houses in it to protect a science team studying the planet Best idea ever In fact in fits the complete Sci Fi original movie checklist guns dinosaurs medieval times space travel terrible actingSo go watch this movie but don t buy it
0	My wife and I both agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made Certainly in the top ten of those I ve watched all the way through At least Plan was enjoyable I DID really enjoy Christine The Dead Zone Firestarter Carrie and some of his other films I didn t care much for Cujo only because the sound was so bad on versions I ve seen and I often couldn t tell what people were saying or Pet Sematary Pet Cemetery But this mess was a total mistake in every way possible The creatures themselves seemed designed by a year old No offense to year olds Even the one liners made us groan and weren t remotely amusing
0	The dancing was probably the ONLY watchable thing about this film and even that was disappointing compared to some other films My gawd To me this is the worst kind of film one that assumes it s a work of art because it has all the trappings of film as art Yes it s beautifully photographed but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself Tango is a tease it s hot it has drama it s audacious precisely what this film is not
0	Ulli Lommel s film The Boogey Man is no classic but it s an above average low budget chiller that s worth a look The sequel s Boogey Man II is ultimately a waste of time but at the very least it s an entertaining one if not taken the least bit seriously Now II left the door open for another sequel and I for one wouldn t have minded seeing at least one more One day while I was browsing though the videos at a store in the mall I came across a film entitled Return of the Boogey Man When I found out it was a sequel to the earlier films I was happy to shell out a few bucks for it I should have known better Though the opening title is Boogey Man this is no sequel to those two far superior films I named above Well not totally anyway Pros Ha That s a laugh Is there anything good about this hunk of cow dung Let s see it has footage from The Boogey Man and um it s mercifully short Yeah that s about it Cons Where to start Decisions decisions First of all this movie is a total bore It goes from one scene to the next without anything remotely interesting or scary happening The acting is stiff at best The actors are most likely friends of the director who had no acting experience whatsoever before and probably none since The plot is nonexistent and script shoddily written The direction is just plain awful The director tries to make the film look all artsy fartsy by making the camera move around lights flicker and with filters but it adds nothing The music is dull and hard to hear in parts Ties to the original are botched Suzanna Love s character was named Lacey not Natalie And the events depicted in the beginning of the original did not take place in Also if this has a in the title why is there no mention of what happened in II Finally this adds nothing new or interesting to either the series or the genre Final thoughts The people behind this waste of time and money should be ashamed of themselves It s one thing if that had been an original film that was the director s first and sucked But instead it s supposed to be a sequel to film that is no masterpiece but is damn sure far more interesting and entertaining than this If there ever is another sequel which I doubt it then it needs to forget this one ever happened and be handled either by Lommel himself or someone who has at least some idea of how to make a decent horror film My rating
1	This is in my opinion much better than either of the s versions but is still not all that good It feels dated probably because it is but it does stand up well compared to other BBC s period pieces such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey The length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the s versions and St John Rivers is at least covered although not very well Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester but the actress playing Jane is much too old There is definitely scope for a TV adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it
1	There is no relation at all between Fortier and Profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes Profiler looks crispy Fortier looks classic Profiler plots are quite simple Fortier s plot are far more complicated Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect if we have to spot similarities The main character is weak and weirdo but have clairvoyance People like to compare to judge to evaluate How about just enjoying Funny thing too people writing Fortier looks American but on the other hand arguing they prefer American series Maybe it s the language or the spirit but I think this series is more English than American By the way the actors are really good and funny The acting is not superficial at all
0	I just sat in the theater bored as hell i wanted to leave halfway through the movie The plot is simple Samoan guys wreck weddings So They have to bring a dates in order to get into the wedding Yawn The thing that peeved me off the most was the so called crude jokes They were highly UNfunny clich d and thrown in your face to make you get into the already dull movie The acting was below average and i felt this movie just went on and on about nothing but a bunch of unfunny jokes and a predictable plot All in all one of the worse movies i ve seen of unfunny bad acting just ugly Well thank god a friend shouted me Avoid
0	I can just about understand why some people might wish to stress this film s link with the Eighties but I really wouldn t say it s an accurate depiction of most peoples lives in that era even on the poorest Bradford estates It is however typical of the blunt agitprop rubbish the dear old Royal Court Theatre was churning out at that time Plenty of right on artistry for small small audiences but enough well connected backslapping to ensure future commissions for turgid playrights IThe simple fact is that if you want to reflect upon truer common experience you ll find millions more nodding in knowing agreement to love and live as depicted in Gregory s Girl I would be tempted to call this a kitchen sink drama but that would be doing a great disservice to the plumbing industry However as far as having a decent script is concerned this film is indeed all washed up For some reason it has accrued an odd following amongst Guardian reading film goers I can only assume they get a visual frisson out of pretending to slum it Steer clear my friends It is a poor film with a poor script that likes to think it is breaking boundaries by adding humorous insights into grim life on the estates it isn t but it is grim Do the washing up instead

1	Bruce Almighty one of Carrey s best pictures since well a long time It contains one of the funniest scenes I have seen for a long time too Morgan Freeman plays God well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny It contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes The best scene in it is where Jim is messing up the anchor man s voice My rating
1	Kazan s early film noir won an Oscar Some of the reviews here go into extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism and rate it very highly I can almost see where they are coming from But I prefer to take a more toned down approach to a long forgotten film that appears to have been shot on practically no budget and in quasi documentary fashion Pneumonic plague is loose in the streets of New Orleans and it is up to a military doctor Widmark and a city detective Douglas to apprehend the main carrier Palance The film is moody shot in stark black and white and makes very good use of locations Widmark is wonderful as usual Forget the symbolism crime equals disease and disease equals crime and just enjoy the chase It is not always easy watching a film like this now that we are well into this new century as it is of a particular style that was very short lived post WWII through the early s and will unlikely be of interest to the casual film watcher For those who will be watching this for the first time sit tight for the big chase at the end It is something else and frankly I don t know how they filmed some of it I can say it probably took as long to film the finale as it did the first percent of the movie
0	Ha without a doubt Tommy s the evil one here i don t know why but for some reason little kids in horror movies tend to come across as little butt munches and since they re kids they won t die because they re annoying well except for asylum of terror but those are few and far between Anyway onto the movie Can t find this movie on DVD sure you can all you have to do is buy the Chilling classics DVD pack not only do you get Metamorphosis on DVD for but you also get OTHER MOVIES what a bargain pff OK i m done advertising for these cheesy movies let s just say this movie ain t worth the bucks on its own So we have a chemist scientist yeah cause all chemist scientists look as handsome as this guy playing Peter He s trying to come up with a serum to stop deterioration of the body the college he works at wants to pull the plug on his project so he tries it on himself but because this is a horror movie he sucks it up and starts and incredibly long transformation sequence that takes nearly of the movie To pad out the movie he gets into a relationship with some woman who has a son and she was never married scandalous But of course Tommy is one of the most irritating characters no i take it back HE IS the most irritating character Far worse than the old crippled guy who wants to take over peter s work and gloats over him while he s in the hospital that s right even as an old cripple you can still be the villain So we see Peter start to randomly kill some people in visions he has until he realizes he s the one doing it and just decides to kill everyone in his path to get back to normal However at the end he ends up de evolving into a lizard yeah i know don t ask The ending really doesn t make any sense And if you re hoping for any really good payoff you re not going to get it This isn t a HORRIBLE movie it s just frustrating because of the lack of a good payoff if you already own the movie pack and this is next on your list you re not in for a snoozer but you re also not in for a great movie Just sit back relax and eat a lot of snack food Because this movie isn t going to be making you jump out of your skin anytime soon Metamorphosis gets plastic lizard heads out of
1	Come on people This movie is better than I can see this happening wealthy people have done crazier things than this And it was funny I watch a comedy to be entertained escape from the pressures of the world for a short while and not to have to take anything too seriously This movie fully suits that purpose I judge a movie on its own merits and am not about to compare Surviving Christmas to Blazing Saddles I watched totally dysfunctional people grow into caring likable individuals who could easily live down the street from my home It will remain on my list of favorite must watch for the holiday season If you just want to have a fun minutes watch this one
1	A new way to enjoy Goldsworthy s work Rivers and Tides allows fans to see his work in motion Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces one develops an appreciation for every stone leaf and thorn that he uses Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life the rivers and the tides inspires and affects his work Although I was happy the film covered the majority of Goldsworthy s pieces no snowballs I do feel it was a bit long The film makers did a wonderful job of bringing Goldsworthy s work to life and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch
0	This is it This is the one This is the worst movie ever made Ever It beats everything I have never seen worse Retire the trophy and give it to these people there s just no comparison Even three days after watching this for some reason I still don t know why I cannot believe how insanely horrific this movie is was Its so bad So far from anything that could be considered a movie a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existence This made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good It made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe This type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society We should be ashamed I really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good It s an embarrassment I don t know how on earth any of these actors writers or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making Loaded I don t know what type of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of movies That being said I love a good bad movie I love Shark Attack I love Bad Taste they are HILARIOUS I tell all my friends to see them because they are bad But this this crosses the line of bad into a whole new dimension This is awkward bad This is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen every line every action every death every sequence BEFORE they happen and not just like a second or two before I mean like after watching the first minutes before Every cheesy editing effect is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point I really never want to see the shaky camera drug buzz rush effect or jump cuts or swerve cuts or ANY FANCY CUT EVER AGAIN EVER This is meticulously boring repetitive and just tortures the audience But and let me be specific here the most DISTURBING thing about this movie is that given the production it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement I personally will grab the shoulders of the director if I ever see him and shake him into submission demanding that he run home and swallow two gallons of Drain O or I will do it for him If we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again Trust me I think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the nd time of sitting through this Stop these movies they are just the most vile of all facets of our society Please Stop NOW
0	The Cat in the Hat is just a slap in the face film Mike Myers as The Cat in the Hat is downright not funny and Mike Myers could not have been any worse This is his worst film he has ever been in The acting and the story was just terrible I mean how could they make the most beloved stories by Dr Seuss be made into film and being one of the worst films of all time and such a disappointment I couldn t have seen a more worst film than this besides maybe Baby Geniuses But this film is just so bad I can t even describe how badly they made this film Bo Welch should be fired or the writer should Hedeen s outlook No Stars F
0	Up until the last few minutes of the movie I would have given the movie a score of or stars However the ending is so terrible and Hollywoodized that it completely undermines the first of the movie The plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they received an order to fire their nuclear missiles The Captain Gene Hackman is all for launching while his first officer Denzel Washington is in favor of confirming the launch orders first The problem is to launch BOTH the captain and st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys Hackman is determined to launch and Washington stands firm until eventually this results in armed insurrection aboard the sub Eventually the mistake is discovered and the missiles are not launched Cool However here comes the part that just doesn t ring true After they are back on land and go before a review board Washington and Hackman who d just spent half the movie trying to kill each other shake hands and are all buddy buddy Huh Too trite an ending to make the movie worth while for me
1	Even years after the end of the Vietnam war Jacknife came not too late or was even superfluous It s one of the few that try to deal with the second sad side of the war The time after Different from movies like Taxi driver or Rambo which use to present their main characters as broken heroes in a bad after war environment this movie allows the audience to face a different view on the Vietnam vets Their development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war The problems are obvious but in all this tragic there is always the feeling of some hope on the basis of love and friendship Jacknife might be the quietest Vietnam movie ever but after almost years this is really plausible and therefor justified Moreover it can make us believe that the war has not finished yet at least for some of us The three main characters are amazing De Niro has done one of his best jobs but Ed Harris is the star of this movie Possibly this was his best performance ever
1	Every now and then there gets released this movie no one has ever heard of and got shot in a very short time with very little money and resource but everybody goes crazy about and turns out to be a surprisingly great one This also happened in the s with quite a few little movies that not a lot of people have ever heard of There are really some unknown great surprising little jewels from the s that are worth digging out Panic in the Streets is another movie like that that springs to the mind Both are movies that aren t really like the usual genre flicks from their time and are also made with limited resources I was really surprised at how much I ended up liking this movie It was truly a movie that got better and better as it progressed Like all old movies it tends to begin sort of slow but once you get into the story and it s characters you re in for a real treat with this movie The movie has a really great story that involves espionage though the movie doesn t start of like that It begins as this typical crime thriller with a touch of film noir to it But Pickup on South Street just isn t really a movie by the numbers so it starts to take its own directions pretty soon on It ensures that the movie remains a surprising but above all also really refreshing one to watch I also really liked the characters within this movie None of them are really good guys and they all of their flaws and weaknesses Really humane It also especially features a great performance from Thelma Ritter who even received a well deserved Oscar nomination for It has really got to be one of the greatest female roles I have ever seen Even despite its somewhat obvious low budget this is simply one great original special little movie that deserves to be seen by more
1	Okay my title is kinda lame and almost sells this flick short I remember watching Siskel Ebert in talking about this movie and then playing a clip or two Not being a rap conscious guy although I could identify Snoop Dogg Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer music I wasn t much interested when they started talking about the film But then S E showed the scene where the band explains how they picked their name using some shady logic and a bunch of made up facts and then another scene where the band and their rival band both visit a school to promote getting involved and of course NWH comes up with some info about how the rival band leader is a loser because he got good grades in school and was on the yearbook committee So I filed it away that I should see this movie A couple of years later this thing shows up on HBO and I recorded it only to laugh my butt off for hours Yes it has a Spinal Tap kind of rhythm to it even the documentarist takes essentially the same tone in setting up the clips and the band follows a similar path what I now call the Behind the Music phenomenon smalltime band has good chemistry gets famous too much money too fast squabbling drugs some type of death band breaks up then reconciles finishing with a hope for more albums in the future and fade to black The one thing that is true is that in Spinal Tap you catch the band perhaps with a little more success in their past But Tap drags at some points and in my mind is reduced to laughs that are set up by specific scenes Oh this is his rant about the backstage food this is spot where he wants the amp to go to ELEVEN this is the spot where the guy makes the pint sized stonehenge etc Contrasting to FoaBH which seems to have more unexpected humor You can see some of it coming but there isn t a big setup for every joke Sometimes the jokes just kinda flow Cundieff and the other actors in the band had a real chemistry that worked Also the direct references to Vanilla Ice Hammer and a bunch of other caricature type rappers really worked well This strikes me as a film you watch once to get the main story and laughs and then go back and watch to catch the subtle jokes And the songs Is My Peanuts better than Big Bottom from Spinal Tap I don t know but they re both damn funny Tone Def s awful video during his awakening phase is so bizarre yet so funny I could go on awhile but save your time and don t waste it on CB I watched the first half hour and got bored You don t get bored on FoaBH There are slightly less funny moments but you can never tell when something good is about to happen Perhaps my favorite scene is when Ice Cold and Tastey Taste name ripoffs if I ve ever heard any discover they ve been sharing the same girl at one point you ve got those two pointing guns at each other and the next thing you know the manager the photographer the girl and I think even Tone Def are in the room pointing guns at each other switching targets back and forth And of course someone does get shot I did find it odd that NWH s managers suffered similar fates to Spinal Tap s drummers although none spontaneously combusted I don t think There were enough similarities that I cannot ignore the likelihood that Cundieff saw Spinal Tap prior to writing this film although this is clearly much more the Spinal Tap of hip hop While some similarities exist the humor is different and the movie seems more like a real documentary maybe because we don t recognize a single actor in this thing even the guy who played Lamar from Revenge of the Nerds All in all this movie has in my opinion street cred Kinda like NWH
1	I generally find Loretta Young hard to take too concerned with her looks and too ladylike in all the wrong ways But in this lyrical Frank Borzage romance and even though she s playing a low self esteem patsy who puts up with entirely too much bullying from paramour Spencer Tracy she s direct and honest and irresistible It s an odd little movie played mostly in a one room shack in a Hooverville unusually up front about the Depression yet romantic and idealized Tracy playing a blustery hard to take regular guy who would be an awful chauvinist and bully by today s standards softens his character s hard edge and almost makes him appealing There s good supporting work from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell who never got as far as she should have and Jo Swerling s screenplay is modest and efficient But the real heroes are Borzage who always liked to dramatize true love in lyrical close up and Young You sort of want to slap her and tell her character to wise up she s too good for this guy but she s so dewy and persuasive you contentedly watch their story play out to a satisfying conclusion
1	A brilliant Russian migr devises the Stanislavsky system for winning at contract bridge which makes him and his beautiful wife the GRAND SLAM Sweethearts of America What could have been just another silly soap opera is elevated by fine production values excellent acting to the status of a very enjoyable little comedy A few unexpected touches are thrown in to keep the viewer s attention engaged the way in which the principle cast is introduced as faces on a deck of cards the introduction of a zany acrobat into the plot for no other reason than to enjoy a bit of lunacy and the way in which a wide variety of different kinds of Americans are shown to be transfixed by listening to the broadcast of the concluding game Paul Lukas Loretta Young do very well as the Bridge Sweethearts Lukas suave sophisticated and Miss Young passionately loving and beautiful even if the script keeps her puffing on a cigarette a bit too much They are fun to watch even when their behavior is not always the most believable or compelling Frank McHugh gives another good performance as a relentlessly cheerful ghost writer who adores Miss Young The delightful Glenda Farrell eschews her customary wisecracking persona in a small role as McHugh s ditsy gal pal Roscoe Karns handles the fast talking dialogue as a brash radio announcer Diminutive Ferdinand Gottschalk is wonderful as a snobbish bridge expert Movie mavens will recognize Dewey Robinson as a belligerent nightclub patron Emma Dunn as a sob sister reporter Paul Porcasi as the owner of the Russian nightclub Charles Lane as a Russian waiter and Jimmy Conlin as a kibitzer at the final bridge game all uncredited The film takes advantage of the fad for contract bridge which had swept across the country since its development in the s It expects the viewer to have a basic knowledge of the intricacies of the game and makes no attempt to explain anything to the uninformed
0	It s the early s There s a group of suspiciously old looking teens And there s a maniac stalking around Yes this is slasherville This movie is called Pranks Why is it called Pranks I haven t the faintest idea Unless your idea of a great prank is to repeatedly hit someone s dinner with a baseball bat on balance not a great prank in fact quite a rubbish prank if truth be told But there you go The film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory They become aware that a psychopath is on the loose To combat this development they split up and wander about in the dark It ends in tears for most of them Pranks is a badly made slasher movie The DVD release I viewed was the Vipco one It appears to be cut of a fair bit of violence This makes the DVD even more pointless because let s face it a slasher movie shorn of violence is a waste of time For slasher film and video nasty completists only
0	Annie Potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the Corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie and heads off to Las Vegas with Annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joy I would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it wasn t for the fun of watching Annie Potts in a very early role and it s too bad for Hamill that he didn t take a few acting lessons from her Danny Bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo
1	I ve seen this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time I still FELT it The story itself was incredible but came alive by Spielberg s expertise and the fabulous cast including Whoopi Goldberg Oprah Winfrey Danny Glover and Margaret Avery Akosua Busia deserved an Oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of Nettie You ll experience every human emotion while watching this film I laughed cried and got angry Like most great movies it was looked over by the Academy with a host of nominations but no wins But this movie without a doubt is definitely one of the best films of all time
0	At first i thought that it was just about Eddie Murphy talking to some stupid animals I was right Some people called this movie Eddie Murphy s comeback Who are these people Jesus if this is the best he can come up with he can just stay away What was the story again I was so annoyed by all the lame jokes i forgot I should have walked out on this one
0	Man the ending of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy Now most of the rest of the film was okay It had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing Yes Alderich is a great director who made FLight Of The Phoenix and Whatever Happened TO Baby Jane among others The problem isn t with direction acting or anything technical The movie is just destroyed in the third act Why The murders twists turns and characters have all been revolving around NUCLEAR MATERIAL What the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that The way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest Deus Ex Machina in history For all the complaints about Burton s Planet of the Apes THe life of David Gale or Notorious I think THIS is the worst ending ever What a let down
1	An interesting animation about the fate of a giant tiger a sloth and a mammoth who saved a baby who was close to be killed by a group of tigers during the ice age The morale of the film shows that good behavior with the others may bring benefits at the end One of the tigers in the group got an order to finally capture the baby who was hardly saved by his mother when the tigers attacked her community The baby was then rescued by the sloth and the mammoth but the tiger joined them with the objective of finally taken away the baby They went through very troublesome paths with plenty of danger and at once the tiger was to fall down and saved by the mammoth At the end the group of tigers tried to capture the baby but the mammoth helped incredibly by his tiger colleague was able to overcome this attack and to give the baby back to his father and the community to which he belongs
