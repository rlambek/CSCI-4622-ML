1	This film could be one of the most underrated film of Bollywood history This blockbuster had all of it good performances music and direction I remember I was in Allahabad when this movie was running and it was somewhere in March at Holi time the people there were playing its song Ooe Amma at their loudspeakers in highest volume If someone who likes to watch Some Like It Hot and drools over Marilyn Monroe he should see this movie Thumbs Up to Govinda How many of you know that this film was shot in South of India and after Sholay could be one of the very few blockbuter to hit Silver Screen With films like these Indian comedy could never be dead
1	Four stories written by Robert Bloch about various people who live in a beautiful old mansion and what happens to them The first has Denholm Elliott as a novelist who sees the killer he s writing about come to life Some spooky moments and the twist at the end was good The second has Peter Cushing becoming obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife The third has Christopher Lee who has a child Chloe Franks and is scared of her It all leads up to a pretty scary ending although the ending in the story was MUCH worse The last is an out and out comedy with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt both chewing the scenery and a cape that turns people into vampires There s also a cute line about Christopher Lee playing Dracula This is a good horror anthology nothing terrifying but the first one and the ending of the third gave me a few pleasurable little chills Also the fourth one is actually very funny and Pitt makes a VERY sexy vampire Also the house itself looks beautiful and very creepy It s well directed with some nice atmospheric touches A very good and unusual movie score too All in all a good little horror anthology well worth seeking out Try to see it on DVD the Lions Gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound
0	I really have no idea how to comment on this movie The special effects were lackluster the acting was terrible and if there was a plot to it all it was on the back of the box I don t think I can remember a movie being THIS bad in a long time and I m a big fan of lesbian sex and boobies Even that couldn t save this movie from being just a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand or lay in this case in front of a camera I was pretty much let down by the overall zombie effect Since apparently in this movie zombies are so commonplace that running over a couple here and there and casually talking about it at a gas station one with an in house windshield repair but no interior bathroom the zombie movie genre isn t even a factor until the end Even then a cameo by a dozen zombies ripping off a girl s clothes doesn t really constitute being a zombie movie On to the vampires Apparently all the zombies are male and all the vampires are female which is OK by me I m not sure how vampires are out in the daylight or the why how of a soldier vampire came to be standing in the middle of the road still holding his gun with a stake through his heart just waiting for the Queen of the Vampires to flick it all the way through The last segment in the old nunnery made no sense and when one hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire Do you think we did the right thing by killing the two apparent heroes in the movie that about put it over the top The acting and special effects were at an all time low also You could almost see the hoses that the fake blood was pumped out of during the closeup of the zombie who got ran over by the General Speaking of the General where did they find THIS Kenny Rogers look alike anyways No idea what he was the General of aside of generally confusing and misplaced All in all watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have the strong urge to waste Just my
1	I just saw Hot Millions on TCM and I had completely forgotten this gem Ustinov creates a clever and divisive plot that has him cleverly going from two bit con man to ingenious Well you ll see Maggie Smith is perfect as the bumbling secretary neighbor who has a tough time holding a job but has a warm and vibrant personality that beams through in this picture She creates a fine portrayal of a warm witty and real person who in the long run well Molden and Newhart as top executives take on the challenge of making what could be banal roles and make them come out into a comic life of their own Robert Morley and Ceasar Romero are just a pleasure to see and I know at least in Romero s case Ustinov is extending a helping hand of work This film is meant to be a shot back at the rising computer age and it s problems for the average con man or man for that matter but in fact the characters are so involving and so much fun to watch that the computer sub plot is almost lost I say almost Let down your usual expectations of modern comedy and look for the great performances and friendly forgiving and deeply involving plot in this picture
0	this is the perfect example of something great going awfully bad hence can i advice anyone to watch it well i was kinda obliged by the fact that in was in the tiff competition i still can t believe it won and i only remained until the end because the director was there for a q a section but that was also anything but interesting what s it about well the first half the worth watching one presents three characters a hooker a musician and some kind of official the first two lie about their professions but the third is the actual liar the second half do something else don t ruin a good evening includes some old breasts and heavy drinking but maybe you will see it completely different the tiff jury did were they drinking vodka
0	This movie bewilders me It may be that I m just a stupid American but I really just don t get Blows Everything I ve read about this movie has been a total rave but I just couldn t stay interested I m sure that it was as revolutionary in film making as all the critics say but when it boils right down to it it s just really really boring Maybe it s the language barrier may I m just not sensitive or artsy enough but whatever the case is I hated this movie The story itself isn t bad it s about a young French boy who is treated unfairly by his parents and his teachers and eventually he ends up in a juvenile facility That in itself ought to be interesting and it was at first There was nothing wrong with the dialogue but then again it s hard to say because half of the conversations weren t subtitled and for no apparent reason so I didn t always know what was going on But for the dialogue we could understand it made enough sense The actors were believable enough but it s hard to say what a real person would do in these situations So you feel for the main character but only in the sense that when he gets into trouble you think well that sucks The plot isn t even your typical plot Each time he gets in trouble he gets into more trouble than the last time but the reasons never vary too much And through the entire film you realize that there s nothing the main character can really do about it So it s more like just waiting to see how it ends The ending by the way was completely over my head It s way too artsy for me and I just didn t get it Leading up to the end was easy enough to follow The structure was certainly there and it made sense as well but everything was really drawn out For the amount of dialogue and significant moments the movie could have been an hour shorter It just didn t end Part of it was the unnecessarily long shots none of which were especially memorable for example the ending was a clip of the main character running down a country road that lasted a good thirty seconds Now I m sure that had some deeper meaning in it somewhere but for the average viewer I d rather have gotten up to get some more food during that time Or at least done something a little more useful than sit and watch this boy running like doing my laundry or taking a nap Final Verdict The feeling throughout the whole movie was that this probably would be very moving and just amazing and that it would teach me some great life lesson if I could only get what the director was trying to say by his unique decisions As it was I just felt cheated out of a good two hours of my life
0	Ugh what can I say other than ugh I rented this film because it was labeled as a sequel to the original Vampires This movie could not have been any lamer Lacking not only in plot but the acting is atrocious Combined with some obvious plot holes makes this movie a very hard one to watch Many times I questioned my own sanity at continuing to watch the film long after the plot had jumped the shark Here s a sampling of the lamer aspects SPOILERS Professional Slayer insists on sleeping outdoors by himself at night He wakes up to a woman crying sitting no more than feet from him in the middle of nowhere He immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance She goes from crying to seducing him and he lets it happen with obvious results One of the main characters is Zoe was bitten by a Vampire but as long as she takes these experimental pills she got in Mexico City she s fine although her body temperature is below room temperature Guard outside of monastery where hero is staying the night is killed by vampires hero leaves the next day He then returns a day later only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he left avoid this movie
0	Florence Chadwick was actually the far more accomplished swimmer of course She swam the English Channel both directions She swam from Catalina Island to the California coast Marilyn Bell s is a sweet story but the usual glorification of us Canadians in the face of a superior world Another sample of our inferiority complex Our political system works pretty well and the health system allows people not to die in hospital lobbies That s pretty good Better than Lebanon What should we do about hockey though And curling The notion of calling this a sport of its inclusion in the Olympics ah but we digress
1	After all the crap that Hollywood and the Indies have churned out we finally get a movie that delivers some scary moments There are some clich d moments but I m not sure it s possible nowadays to make an entirely original movie There s not much new here it s just done well Make sure and pay attention as the subtle scares come quickly and often This is not a movie to watch while you re eating pizza There s one very well written red herring in this movie and unfortunately one very poorly cast role Cheri Christian just doesn t make an effective Julie the wife mother For one thing she s totally unsympathetic I know I know she s just gone through a traumatic experience But the viewer never gets to know her as she normally is and the relationship between her and her husband is rather discomforting in an unintentional way I think that the director had meant for us to have some sympathy for her but I never did Finally a thumbs up for the ending which is both disturbing and satisfying It could easily have been cheapened with a sound effect at the beginning of the end credits but the director wisely resisted This is not a masterpiece by any means but it IS a good old fashioned scary movie something that s rather rare nowadays
1	Maybe I loved this movie so much in part because I ve been feeling down in the dumps and it s such a lovely little fairytale Whatever the reason I thought it was pitch perfect Great intelligent story beautiful effects excellent acting especially De Niro who is awesome This movie made me happier than I ve been for a while It is a very funny and clever movie The running joke of the kingdom s history of prince savagery and the aftermath the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled That s much of what makes it so good it s an elaborate special effects laden movie with more story than most fairytale movies yet there is an incredible attention to small things I feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again
1	It s not well shot well written or well acted but it has to be the most addictive show I ve seen since Twin Peaks Every single revelation is timed so well that you have to see the next episode to get any kind of closure They have even slowed down the pace of the show where they only reveal tiny amounts of information per episode however it feels like they ve just told you everything you wanted to know However some of the acting is just about awful and some of the duologue is downright brutal Some characters are very two dimensional The more experienced actors like Locke and Ecko really stand out over actors who play Jack Kate Sayid and so on The development of the show can also be very frustrating as the following episode may not show what the previous episode lead up to Annoying side plots have become part of the story that sometimes tell you nothing However the second season has developed to a point where back stories reveal more about the island than they had previously All in all its a great show but not perfect
0	When will I ever learn The ecstatic reviewer on NPR made me think this turkey was another Citizen Kane Please allow me to vent my spleen I will admit the setting presumably New York City has never been so downright ugly and unappealing I am reminded that the s was a bad decade for men s fashion and automobiles And all the smoking If the plan was to cheapen the characters it succeeded For a film to work at least in my simple estimation there has to be at least ONE sympathetic character Only Ned Beaty came close and I could not wait for him to finish off Nicky If a stray shot had struck Mikey well it may have elicited a shrug of indifference at the most I can t remember when I detested a film as strongly I suppose I m a rube who doesn t dig art flicks Oh well
1	This film never received the attention it deserved although this is one of the finest pieces of ensemble acting and one of the most realistic stories I have seen on screen Clearly filmed on a small budget in a real V A Hospital the center of the story is Joel very well played by Eric Stoltz Joel has been paralyzed in a motorcycle accident and comes to the hospital to a ward with other men who have spinal injuries Joel is in love with Anna his married lover played by Helen Hunt who shows early signs of her later Academy Award winning work Although the Joel Anna relationship is the basic focus there are many other well developed characters in the ward Wesley Snipes does a tremendous job as the angry Raymond Even more impressive is William Forsythe as the bitter and racist Bloss I think Forsythe s two best scenes are when he becomes frustrated and angry at the square dancers and later when he feels empathy for a young Korean man who has been shot in a liquor store hold up My favorite scene with Snipes is the in the roundtable discussion of post injury sexual options The chemistry between Stoltz and Hunt is very strong and they have two very intimate but not gratuitous sex scenes The orgasm in the ward is both sexy and amusing There is also another memorable scene where Joel and Bloss and the Korean boy take the specially equipped van to the strip bar It s truly a comedy of errors as they make their feeble attempts to get the van going to see the naked ladies The story is made even more poignant by the fact that the director Neal Jimenez is paralyzed in real life This is basically his story This film is real not glossy or flashy To have the amount of talent in a film of such a small budget is amazing I recommend this film to everyone I see because it is one of those films that even improves on a second look It s a shame that such a great piece of work gets overlooked but through video perhaps it can get the attention it so richly deserves
0	If you ve ever been harassed on the Underground by a Christian who says Jesus is the answer What s the question then perhaps you should thank God if you ve never met a Lacanian Slavoj Zizek the most evangelical of Lacanians would surely exchange the word Jesus in that statement for Lacan Hegel Zizek s star burns brightly at the moment no doubt because we generally view films and pop culture purely as entertainment for our consumption So it seems impressive when someone anyone comes along and says Hang on films may say something about ourselves The ideas Zizek expounds in this film are true purely because he says so For example Zizek explains that three Marx Bros are the ego superego and id God knows what happened to Zeppo or Gummo perhaps they re the sinthome or is that movies themselves This is simply what they are In Zizek s output culture is not there to be investigated but merely to be held as an example of his ideology People may object that he certainly has something to say but how different is what he says from the Christian attributing everything to God s will What s wrong with taking examples from films or anywhere to illustrate theory Well nothing at all As Zizek seems to believe they may even serve as a proof However it is merely cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from their context Without context you can say and prove anything you want For Zizek Lacan is the answer so he goes and makes an example of it Everything but everything resembles the teachings of the Master and culture is there to bear this out to serve this ideology For instance Zizek s exemplar of the fantasy position of the voyeur is taken from a scene in Vertigo when Jimmy Stewart spies on Kim Novak in a flower shop But in the context of the film this is not a voyeur s fantasy position at all Stewart has been deliberately led there by Novak This presentation of examples isolated from their context continues throughout Zizek s two hour and a half cinematic sermon His analysis of the baby wants to f scene in Blue Velvet is laughable Touching lightly on what he appears to consider to be the horrific to the masculine truth of feminine jouissance Zizek says that Isabella Rossilini s character not only demands her degradation but is unconsciously in charge of the situation This is an example of her jouissance Well possibly But sorry to be prosaic where is the evidence for this In the film she partially undergoes her humiliations because Hopper has kidnapped her son Zizek may object that she also evidently enjoys rough sex with Kyle MacLachalan But this may be due to any number of things Isn t that the point of so called feminine jouissance According to Lacan feminine jouissance unlike phallic jouissance cannot be articulated it is beyond the phallic capture and castration of language If this is right then no example can be made of it It also means that the entire concept is non sensical and entirely mystical It can only be designated by dogmatists such as Zizek There s feminine jouissance for you Why is this feminine jouissance Because I say so What example can really be garnered from these films Only Zizek s psychology Why does he keep inserting himself into his favourite films even to the point that when in a boat on Botega Bay he says he wants to f Rod Steiger too Is this not the wish fulfilment of someone who spends his life critiquing films As the saying goes Freud would have a field day with The Pervert s Guide to the Cinema but with Zizek himself nobody else Zizek s theory that films show us how we desire may be right on the face of it but these films cannot be strict universal examples of psychoanalytical laws This film illustrates how Zizek desires and only extremely vaguely as to be almost useless how the rest of us desire For as any psychoanalyst knows how we desire and what we desire cannot be fully separated and cannot be easily universalised if at all Zizek s love of making everything an example of Lacan s Answer bears this out how do we desire like this this is how I do it Problem is in Zizek s desire everything and everyone else is rationalised into his desire But Zizek is a Leninist and they certainly don t like letting the subject speak for itself The Pervert s Guide to the Cinema is a summation Zizek s love of dogma and is entirely unphilosophical even if it remains very political what dogma isn t Zizek has never questioned exactly what his motives might be when embarking on an analysis what he is trying to discover because the terms of his exploration and therefore his ethics in doing so are never put into question Zizek is extremely prolific but all his books and this film say the same thing He s a kind of Henry Ford of cultural theory mass production and any colour as long as it s black He is perfect for today s highly consumerist society supposedly critical while giving people the same c ap over and over and pretending that it is something different This is popular because people largely prefer readymade answers to their problems which capitalism always claims to provide rather than investigating things with any serious consideration at all Which is kind of like being brain dead For me Zizek s third Matrix pill is a suicide capsule PS I loved Zizek s solemn remark presented as a revelation about cinema and humanity that music in films can greatly affect people s sympathies Did this only occur to Zizek after he watched Jaws
0	Who What Where When Why The acting was terrible Very robotic rehearsed I have seen all of the actors in this film in better roles The screenplay was very elementary By the end of this film the story line was tied up And Jeane Claude LaMarre should be tied up too So that he never attempts to write direct another film
0	When I read MOST of the other comments I felt they were way too glowing for this movie I found it had completely lost the spark found in the earlier Zatoichi movies and just goes to prove that after a long absence from the screen it s often best to just let things be I completely agreed with the Star Trek analogy from another reviewer who compared the FIRST Star Trek movie to the original series millions of excited fans were waiting and waiting and waiting for the return of the show and were forced to watch a bland and sterile approximation of the original The plot is at times incomprehensible it is terribly gory though the recent NEW Zatoichi by Beat Takeshi is much bloodier and lacks the heart of the originals I didn t mind the blood at all but some may be turned off by it particularly the scenes with the severed nose and the severed heads In addition time has not been good to Ichi he seems a broken and sad man in this film much much more than usual and that s something fans of the series may not really want to see This was a very sorry return for Zatoichi Unless you are like me and want to see EVERY Zatoichi film this one is very skipable See one of the earlier versions or the ALL NEW version
0	This movie was slower then Molasses in January in Alaska The man who put togeather the preview should get an award for managing to put every one of the seconds that were interisting into the preview I had to wake up the people I was watching it with several times After it was over I felt bad for having woken them up Most of the film is taken up with hoping something will actually happen but nothing ever does It was easy to loose track of people s motives and the characters were flat and uninteristing By the end of the movie you just hoped everyone would died Everyone runs around either being contemptible petty or pitiful and usually all three And worse we watched a minute or two of the added features just for kicks and giggles you understand and all that we saw was people being smug about how socially aware they are If they had spend the time on the movie that they did patting themselves on the back it might have been worth watching I was brought in expecting the excitement of I got a lecture on social awareness through the blery eyes of the sandman
1	Hard to believe perhaps but this film was denounced as immoral from more pulpits than any other film produced prior to the imposition of the bluenose Hayes Code Yes indeed priests actually told their flocks that anyone who went to see this film was thereby committing a mortal sin I m not making this up They had several reasons as follows Item Jane likes sex She and Tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their treetop shelter She stretches sensuously and with a coquettish look she says Tarzan you ve been a bad boy So they ve not only been having sex they ve been having kinky sex A few years later under the Hays Code people especially women weren t supposed to be depicted as enjoying sex Item Jane prefers a guileless if wise and resourceful savage Tarzan to a civilized respectable nine to five man Holt When Holt at first wows her with a pretty dress from London she wavers a bit when Holt tries to kill Tarzan and Holt and Jane both believe he s dead she wavers a lot But when she realizes her man is very much alive the attractions of civilization vanish for her And why not Tarzan s and Jane s relationship is egalitarian He lacks the civilized insecurity that would compel him to assert himself as the head of his wife To boot he lacks many more civilized hangups for example jealousy When Holt and his buddy arrive Tarzan greets them both cordially knowing perfectly well that Holt is Jane s old flame When Holt gets her dolled up in a London dress and is slow dancing with her to a portable phonograph Tarzan drops out of a tree and draws his knife Jealous Nope He s merely cautious toward the weird music machine since he s never seen one before Once it s explained he s cool Item Civilized Holt is dirty minded Savage Tarzan is innocently sexy As Jane slips into Holt s lamplit tent Holt gets off on watching her silhouette as she changes into the fancy dress By contrast after Tarzan playfully pulls the dress off kicks her into the swimming hole and dives in after her there follows the most tastefully erotic nude scene in all cinema the pair spends five minutes in a lovely water ballet The scene was filmed in three versions clothed topless and nude the scene was cut prior to the film s release but the nude version is restored in the video now available And when Jane emerges and Cheetah the chimp steals her dress just for a tease Jane makes it clear that her irritation is only because of the proximity of civilized men and their hangups Where is the universal prurience so dear to the hearts of seminarians Nowhere that s where Another reason why the hung up regarded this film as sinful Item The notion that man is the crown of creation and animals are here only for man s use and comfort takes a severe beating Holt and his buddy want to be guided to the elephant graveyard so they can scoop up the ivory and take it home They want Tarzan to guide them to said graveyard You reader are thinking Fat chance and you re right He s shocked He exclaims Elephants sleep which to him explains everything Jane explains Tarzan s feelings which the two gentlemen find ridiculous Item Jane the ex civilized woman is far more resourceful than the two civilized men she accompanies Holt and buddy blow it and find themselves besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals It is Jane who maintains her cool While the boys panic she takes charge barks orders at them and passes out the rifles Item Jane s costume is a sort of poncho with nothing underneath The original idea was for her to be topless with foliage artistically blocking off her nipples which indeed is the case in one brief scene Lastly several men of the cloth complained because the film was called Tarzan and His Mate rather than Tarzan and His Wife No comment Of course Tarzan who has been nursed back to health by his ape friends comes to the rescue routs the white hunters and induces the pack elephants and African bearers to return the ivory they stole to the sacred place whence it came The End So there you have it An utterly subversive film Like all the other films about complex and interesting women see e g Possessed with Rita Hayworth and Raymond Massey which constituted such a flowing genre in the early s and which were brought to such an abrupt end by the adoption of the Hays Code The joie de vivre of this film is best expressed by Jane s soprano version of the famous Tarzan yell A nice touch which was unfortunately abandoned in future productions Let s hear it for artistic freedom feminist Jane and sex
0	Growing up Joe Strummer was a hero of mine but even I was left cold by this film For better and worse The Future Is Unwritten is not a straightforward Behind the Music style documentary Rather it is a biographical art film chock full of interviews performance footage home movies and mostly pointless animation sketches lifted from Animal Farm The movie is coherent but overlong by about a half hour The campfire format while touching in thought is actually pretty annoying in execution First off without titles its hard to even know who half of these interviewees are Secondly who really needs to hear people like Bono Johnny Depp and John Cusack mouth butt licking hosannas about the man They were not relevant to Strummer s life and their opinions add nothing to his story This picture is at it s best when Strummer through taped interviews and conversation touches on facets of his life most people did not know about the suicide of his older brother coming to terms with the death of his parents the joy of fatherhood To me these were most moving because it showed Joe Strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved but as a regular human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life we all must face There have been better more straightforward documentaries about Strummer and The Clash Westway VH Legends and Kurt Loder s narrated MTV Documentary from the early s come to mind Joe Strummer The Future Is Unwritten is for diehards only
1	This is short and to the point The story writing used for Star Trek Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good Acting is all over the map but the main characters over the years seem to have worked at improving their skills It is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost years and will be coming to end mid May I will not rehash what has already been said about the sets and graphics Considering this is all volunteer for no profit it is pretty amazing If this was being ranked as a professional production I would have to give it a for a good story but terrible sets However as a fan based production I have to give it an excellent rating as with the exception with a few other efforts this is in a league of its own For sheer volume I don t think this has been matched Congratulations to the cast and crew for an effort that many admire
1	This is a really old fashion charming movie The locations are great and the situation is one of those old time Preston sturgess movies Fi you want to watch a movie that doesn t demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it The acting is good and I really liked Michael Rispoli He was in Rounders too And While You Were Sleeping The rest of the cast is fun It s just what happens when two people about to get married meet the one that they really love on the weekend that they are planning their own weddings I know sounds kooky but it is And that s what makes it fun to watch It will make your girl friend either hug you or leave you but at least you ll know
0	This movie was awful and an insult to the viewer Stupid script bad casting endless boredom In the usual tradition of Hollywood the government of the US is shown as always evil The Communist sympathizer nitwits in Hollywood most of whom are as dumb as a box of rocks love taking the lone nutcase Eugene McCarthy and picturing him as the leader of a vast movement The truth is that at the time he was considered a fringe character who was exploiting a legitimate concern about the Soviet Communists for political gain Oh yeah and the US brought over all those evil Nazis Like Werner VonBraun without whom we would have no space program He actually loved being American and became a great asset to the country And yet the irony is that the fools in Hollywood an uneducated lot who live a fantasy existence still believe that the government should run EVERYTHING and give us all what we want And yet this is the same government that they continually portray as a consummate evil in films like this
1	SPOILERS included This film surely is the best Amicus production I ve seen so far even though I still have quite a few to check out The House that Dripped Blood is a horror omnibus an anthology that contains four uncanny stories involving the tenants of a vicious hellish house in the British countryside A common mistake in productions like this is wasting too much energy on the wraparound story that connects the separate tales Peter Duffel s film wisely doesn t pay too much attention to that It simply handles about a Scotland Yard inspector who comes to the house to investigate the disappearance of the last tenant and like that he learns about the bizarre events that took place there before All four stories in this film are of high quality level and together they make a perfect wholesome High expectations are allowed for this film since it was entirely written by Robert Bloch Yes the same Bloch who wrote the novel that resulted in the brilliant horror milestone Psycho We re also marking Peter Duffel s solid and very professional debut as a director The four stories chapters if you will in the House that Dripped Blood contain a good diversity in topics but they re almost equally chilling and eerie Number one handles about a horror author who comes to the house along with his wife in order to find inspiration for his new book This starts out real well but after a short while his haunted and stalked by the villain of his own imagination The idea in this tale isn t exactly original but it s very suspenseful and the climax is rather surprising The second story stars Hammer horror legend Peter Cushing as a retired stockbroker Still haunted by the image of an unreachable and long lost love he bumps into a wax statue that looks exactly like her Cushing is a joy to observe as always and even though the topic of Wax Museums isn t new this story looks overall fresh and innovating This chapter also contains a couple of delightful shock moments and there s a constant tense atmosphere It s a terrific warm up for what is arguably the BEST story number Another legendary actor in this one as Christopher Lee gives away a flawless portrayal of a terrified father He s very severe and strict regarding his young daughter and he keeps her in isolation for the outside world Not without reason since the little girl shows a bizarre fascination for witchcraft and voodoo Besides great acting by Lee and the remarkable performance of Chloe Franks as the spooky kid this story also has a terrific gothic atmosphere The devilish undertones in this story along with the creepy sound effects of thunder make this story a must for fans of authentic horror The fourth and final story in which a vain horror actor gets controlled by the vampire cloak he wears is slightly weaker then the others when it comes to tension and credibility but that the overload of subtle humor more or less compensates that There s even a little room for parody in this story as the protagonist refers to co star Christopher Lee in the Dracula series Most memorable element in this last chapter is the presence of the gorgeous Ingrid Pitt The cult queen from The Vampire Lovers certainly is one of the many highlights in the film her cleavage in particular No doubt about it The House that Dripped Blood will be greatly appreciated by classic horror fans I truly believe that with a bit of mood settling preparations this could actually be one of the few movies that ll terrify you and leave a big impression Intelligent and compelling horror like it should be Highly recommended One extra little remark though this film may not repeat MAY NOT under any circumstances be confused with The Dorm that Dripped Blood This latter one is a very irritating and lousy underground s slasher that has got nothing in common with this film except for the title it stole
0	Thunderbirds Director Jonathan Frakes Starring Bill Paxton Ben Kingsley Brady Corbet Thunderbirds are GO And so began Thunderbirds a childhood favorite of mine When I heard that they were going to make a Thunderbirds movie I was ecstatic I couldn t wait to see Thunderbird roar in to save people while Thunderbird would dive deep into the you get the idea I just couldn t wait Then came August when the movie was finally released Critics panned it but I still wanted to go After all as long as the heart was in the same place that was all that mattered to me So I sat down in the theater the only teenager in a crowd of everyone else was over thirty and under ten Quite possibly the most awkward theater experience that I have ever had The movie which is intended to be a prequel focuses on Alan Tracy Brady Corbet the youngest of the Tracy family He spends his days wishing that he could be rescuing people like the rest of his family but he s too young One day he finally gets his chance when The Hood Ben Kingsley traps the rest of his family up on Thunderbird the space station This involves him having to outsmart The Hood s henchmen and rescue his family in time before The Hood can steal all of the money from the Bank of England Trust me the plot sounds like a regular episode of Thunderbirds when you read it on paper Once it gets put on to film what a mess we have on our hands First off the film was intended for children much like the original show was However Gerry Anderson treated us like adults and gave us plots that were fairly advanced for children s programming This on the other hand dumbs down the plot as it tries to make itself a ripoff of the Spy Kids franchise The final product is a movie that tries to appeal to fans of the Thunderbirds series and children while missing both entirely Lame jokes cartoonish sounds and stupid antics that no one really finds amusing are all over this movie and I m sure that Jonathan Frakes is wishing he d never directed this Over all everyone gave a solid performance considering the script that they were all given Ben Kingsley was exceptional as The Hood playing the part extremely well My only complaint about the characters is about The Hood s henchmen who are reduced to leftovers from old Looney Tunes cartoons bumbling about as amazingly enough the kids take them on with ease What s odd about this movie is that while I was watching the movie I had fun But once the lights went up I realized that the movie was fairly bad I was lighter and two hours of my time were now gone A guilty pleasure Perhaps Nonetheless Thunderbirds is a forgettable mess Instead of a big go I m going to have to recommend that you stay away from this movie If the rest of movie could have been like the first ten minutes of it it would have been an incredible film worthy of the Thunderbirds name However we get a movie that only die hard Thunderbirds fans if you d like to watch your childhood torn to pieces or the extremely bored should bother with My rating for Thunderbirds is stars
0	This movie was almost intolerable to sit through I can get beyond the fact that it looks like it was shot with a home video camera and that this movie is supposed to span over weeks in time yet the characters do not once change outfits but the acting broke the th wall to pieces for me I ve seen better acting in a th grade play Aside from that the plot is unrealistic If the man suspected the guy he would have turned him in I was also heavily disappointed that all the killings were done with a gun what kind of gore is that That is not a copycat the Zodiac did not kill using just a gun the authorities would have known it wasn t him Another thing that really bothered me was that they called Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM when that is the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders not the name of the disorder Overall I think this movie is not the kind of movie that could be done with a low budget at least not as low as they had or they could have made sure they had better actors or more gore Plenty of people have went the low budget route with out having to use horrible actors look at Easy Rider that had Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and a low budget
0	This is high grade cheese fare of B movie kung fu flicks Bruce wannabe Lee is played by Bruce Li I think Of course let s show quick clips of Bruce and do closeups of his eyes and if you quint at the right angle during a certain time of the day during the winter solstice it kind of looks like Bruce You ll laugh in awe at how the film splicing isn t very good but some cool deleted scenes from Enter the Dragon are thrown in the mix According to the movie Bruce Lee was killed by a dart while hanging from a helicopter Of course they think this can excuse Bruce Li for trying to be Bruce even though his character is supposed to be Bruce s brother who for some reason still mimes Bruce s gestures and fighting style very POORLY See Bruce go one on one with the cowardly lion The props department stopped by Kay Bee you see Bruce also finds nothing wrong with savagely beating up a crippled man Towards the end the director decided let s throw a flashback for a scene just shown minutes ago They must ve thought that only one celled organisms with attention deficit disorder could fully understand this film
0	This utterly dull senseless pointless spiritless and dumb movie isn t the final proof that the world can forget about Danny Boyle and his post Trainspotting movies The Beach already took care of that What this low budget oddity does is merely to secure his place among those who started very well but got completely lost in drugs booze ego self delusion bad management or whatever it was that lead to this once promising director s quick demise The premise is absurd two losers Ecclestone and some bimbo Jenna G a rapper likely meet by chance and spontaneously start singing with fervour more akin to lunatic asylum inhabitants than a potential hit making duo which they become A friend of theirs an even bigger illiterate loser becomes their manager by smashing a store window and stealing a video camera by which he films them in action and then shows the tape to some music people who actually show interest in this garbage Now I know that the UK in recent years has put out incredible junk but this is ridiculous the music makes Oasis seem like The Beatles During the studio recordings the duo Strumpet change lyrics in every take and Ecclestone quite arrogantly tells the music biz guys to take it or leave it and quite absurdly they do take it Not only is the music total and utter trash but its performers are anti social these NEWCOMERS are supposed to be calling the shots It s just too dumb It s plain awful The dialog is unfunny and goes nowhere and this rags to bitches story has no point and makes no sense It often feels improvised under the influence of drugs Danny Boyle is a complete idiot This little piece of trash is so bad it s embarrassing to watch Ecclestone s I Q also has to be questioned for agreeing to be part of this nonsense Whoever financed this joke should leave the movie business before they end up selling their own underwear on street corners
1	Page is a great movie The story is so refreshing and interesting Not once throughout the movie did i find myself staring off into space Konkana Sen did a good job in the movie although i think someone with more glamour or enthusiasm would have been better but she did do a great job All the supporting actors were also very good and helped the movie along Boman Irani did a great job There is one thing that stands out in this movie THE STORY it is great and very realistic it doesn t beat around the bush it is very straight forward in sending out its message I think more movie like this should be made i am sick of watching the same candy floss movies over and over they are getting hard to digest now Everyone should watch Page it is a great film Just my cents
0	Of the many problems with this film the worst is continuity and re editing it on VHS for a college cable channel many years ago I tried to figure out what exactly went wrong What seems to have happened is that they actually constructed a much longer film and then chopped it down for standard theatrical viewing How much longer to fill in all the holes in the plot as we have it would require about three more hours of narrative and character development especially given the fact that the film we do have is just so slow and takes itself just so seriously That s staggering what could the Halperins have possibly been trying to accomplish here Their previous film White Zombie was a successful low budget attempt to duplicate the early Universal Studios monster films The Mummy Dracula etc and as such stuck pretty close to the zombie mythology that those in North America would know from popular magazines Revolt of the Zombies to the contrary appears to have been intended as some allegory for the politics of modern war This would not only explain the opening and the change of Dean Jagger s character into a megalomaniac but it also explains why the zombies don t actually do much in the film besides stand around look frightening and wait for orders they re just allegorical soldiers not the undead cannibals we ve all come to love and loathe in zombie films I am the equal to any in my dislike for modern war and its politics but I think a film ought to be entertaining first and only later maybe educational And definitely a film about zombies ought to be about zombies Truly one of the most bizarre films in Hollywood history but not one I can recommend even for historic value
0	I shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad That has been done in great detail already many times over The plot started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide boy gangster by numbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles Anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves It is now or years since I watched it during its week run at the cinema before it was pulled yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film I have ever seen I am only making these comments and indeed the only reason I went to see the film is because of the amusing fact that my brother Eddie appeared in it as the second heavy in the pub scene It was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards Rhys Ifan s face in the bar in Russia it was actually filmed at the former Butlins holiday camp at Barry Island My brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever he had recently joined an extras agency and this was his first part Having seen the film it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever I remember there were about people in the whole cinema and this was just a couple of days after it had been released I have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast and rightly so In case you were thinking of renting this film on DVD I would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red hot then jam them into your eye sockets This will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film
0	This tear teaser written by Steve Martin himself is so unbelievably bad it makes you sick to your stomach The plot is pathetic the acting awful and the dialogue is even more predictable than the ending Avoid at all costs
0	This was a blind buy used DVD It totally killed a nice buzz I had going when I hit play It s bubble headed comedy but it s um squalid The plot is ZANY but the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently contrived I ultimately found it depressing to watch Maybe the box lead me to expect something more than an uneven goofy caper film I know I know the quotes on the box the Academy Award nomination mean nothing
1	I ve always enjoyed seeing Chuck Norris in film Although the acting may not be superb the fight scenes are fantastic I also enjoyed seeing Judson Mills perform along side him In my opinion the Norris Brothers have proven themselves to be fine entertainers and this was yet another fine production I hope you take the time to view this movie
0	The movie Slugs is unique because the titular vermin are actually the good guys in this horrific tale of nature gone awry You see these poor slugs have been mutated through the pollution of evil humans and don t mean to do anything malicious they re just slugs slugs with sharp teeth who eat flesh and excrete poison but slugs none the less The real bad guys are the humans who either actively try to destroy our beloved slugs or overreact when they encounter them For example take the scene where the guy puts on the glove full of slugs They were just hanging out in a comfortable work glove when out of nowhere this giant hand came at them and they reacted instinctively defending themselves and biting the guy Now instead of seeking medical attention for his slug bite this guy runs around his greenhouse screaming like an idiot spills some highly volatile chemicals starts a fire knocks a bookcase over on himself and cuts off his own hand then the fire and volatile chemicals mix and his house explodes How can you blame that on the slugs This movie paints a portrait of humans that is less than favorable The characters in this movie include the dumb sheriff who hates everybody the drunk hick who s mean to his dog and the lumpy sidekick whose wife is at least forty five years older than him There s also a set of drunken teensthat get attacked while copulating and we have to see the skinny long haired freaks genitals Meanwhile there s a guy who looks like a demonic Leslie Neilson who yells You don t have the authority to declare happy birthday for some reason Finally this parade of loathsomeness is rounded out by the guy from the MST K classic Pod People whose face explodes after eating a slug laces salad another easily avoided fate blamed on the helpful harmless slugs Humans are portrayed as greedy stupid racist alcoholic and in one pointless scene as would be rapists In the movie s climactic scene the villainous humans try to burn the slugs who are cowering helplessly in the sewers Well since they re idiots the humans succeed in BLOWING UP THE ENTIRE TOWN They alone do more damage than the slugs ever did If you hate humans and I know I do you ll appreciate Slugs If you re a fan of bad cinema you ll also appreciate this crapfest from the director of Pieces and Pod People There s enough bad acting silly dialog illogical plot twists lame special effects pointless scenes and poor dubbing to hold your attention
0	This movie does not really promote kids to be nicer and have better attitudes as a family movie should and this wouldn t be considered family anyway because it has some things in it that children shouldn t be seeing Not the best ABC Family film if you ask me If there were less sexual themes in the movie then maybe it would be better Hollywood isn t doing anything to make a movie better by adding in sexual situations There s really no reason for them At least this is a TV movie I wouldn t want to waste my money on this garbage by renting it If you have other things to do other than watch this movie please proceed to them
0	OVERALL PERFORMANCE At last the long waiting AAG hits the screens Unfortunately it couldn t set progressive fire in the audience The first best thing to talk about the movie is The idea of remaking the mighty SHOLAY And Varma made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie If he repeated the same Ramghad backdrop people will again say there is nothing new in this Different background is appreciative but the way he presented it is not worthy Right from the start of his career with SIVA in Telugu he had been using the same lighting and kind of background I seriously dunno this guy Varma considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis GODFATHER It s all DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH Why would some body use so many Dutch angles and extreme closeup shots The shot division is lame Characters couldn t carry an emotion performances are not to their mark Storytelling is worse Background is really really terrible Babban Amitabhz been over prioritized to his job VARMA produced great villains like Bikumatre Bhavtakur Das Mallik Bhai but this time he failed in carving the all time best characters of Hindi Cinema There s no comparison of Gabbar with Babban Babban is a more psycho rather than a villain still he has a soft corner for his brother It s a gift in this movie Amitabhz performance is not to his mark His appearance itself is pathetic The scar on his nose symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema What ever they worked on Babban is not successful Babban is no comparison with Gabbar Narsimha The first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands If varma did that it would be like teaching ABCD to a Bachelor degree holder Itz good he opened the secret early But the flashback is pathetic Varma couldn t use a great actor like mohanlal to his mark Durga The only character with betterment This character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story Heroo Raj Ghunguroo No body bothers or at least considers these character The utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our heroz These characters carry nothing to this movie RAMGOPALVARMA His quality is degrading diminishing AAG totally can be treated as a C grade movie Sholay is a fire of revenge problem of a town meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated nuisance and fun by Dharmendra AAG never carried an emotion with its characters Storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters Don t compare AAG with sholay still u will not like it If you dare watch this movie You will be burnt alive in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG
1	I could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable The dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with soft core porn In this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks Perhaps for sex as well but not on Indian TV anyway Not being a fan of the genre I couldn t place Jeff Wincott and had no leads to search from Only once Brigitte Nielsen traded in her futuristic nurse coif so mayoral for the high top fade we remember from Beverly Hills Cop II did I make the positive ID on her This movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early s couture or nod and wink schlock la Paul Verhoeven Can we add a genre tag for so bad it s good
0	I was very disappointed by this movie I thought that Scary Movie although not a great movie was very good and funny Scary Movie on the other hand was boring not funny and at times plain stupid The Exorcist Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie James Woods was great Now I ll admit that I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first where I had basically seen them all But bad comedy is still bad comedy Something that really hurt this movie was the timing which ruined some of what might have been good jokes Scenes and jokes drag out way to long Also the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again For example the talking bird Ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time But it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying The routine between the wheelchair guy and Hanson Chris Elliott was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless Some jokes even got repeated from the first movie For example the creaming I guess you would call it of Cindy Anna Faris was funny in Scary Movie because Cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he creamed her But this time around it was out of place and not funny The bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around The scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie But I did enjoy Shorty Marlon Wayans who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film The scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film Don t get me wrong I love the Wayans family and their humor That is why this film is so disappointing they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes
0	I remember watching the BSG pilot I can describe that night exactly I remember what chair I sat in That show was magic It came alive I enjoyed the first two years of BSG I enjoyed parts of the third year even and I watched every episode of the fourth year totally faithfully in great hopes that it would somehow turn around Well it didn t I watched the Caprica pilot and was enthralled There was hope for something good here Then I started watching the regular episodes and they are getting more and more boring It s too obvious too predictable It reminds me of the droll political correctness of his last failed show Virtuality Much of his line work on DS was good When he focused on BSG in an organized way it was good This was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes set by the first BSG series When they departed from that after meeting up with Admiral Cain and the Pegasus it all went to pot It was like he wrote the rest of the show without knowing where he was going Maybe it will improve Maybe it was just a few weak initial episodes But I am very very nervous
1	I had seen this movie long time back but found it amazing and to this day it has never stopped amazing me A wonderful movie that describes the account of a group of Australian commandos who tried to sink some Japanese ships at the Singapore harbor during the height of WW These commandos are caught in plain clothes and they are considered to be spies by the Japanese captors But something happens that hasn t been explored much in any Hollywood WW movie that I have seen A close and friendly bonding develops between the captors and the captives They begin to respect each other while the captain of the captured Australian soldiers become the best of friends with a senior Japanese prison guard This is the most wonderful part of the whole movie and it really tugs your heart Soon one day as the two friends are conversing the Aussie captain learns that some other captives are going to be tried and executed for the sinking of the Jap ships in the Singapore harbor He mentions that it was his team and not some other s that had sunk the ships to his Japanese friend and upon hearing this the Japanese guard tells him to keep quiet as it might lead to his whole group getting executed But the captain remains adamant on confessing this to the Japanese authorities Finally the Japanese authorities sentence them to death in the most respectful way that is according to their rules This is the Highest Honor accorded to the captured warriors in Japan This is the most awesome part of the film where the Aussie soldiers are awaiting their imminent death and the tense indecision of the friendly Japanese guard who is still not ready to believe that why did his Aussie friend confess being guilty I won t give away the ending here But it is more poignant than one can even imagine and can easily move one to tears All in all an excellent underrated movie that possibly didn t get the recognition that it deserved internationally Get one copy today and be mesmerized
1	Darius Goes West is the touching story of a brave teen coping with Duchenne s Muscular Dystrophy and his personal quest to see the Pacific Ocean He receives help and encouragement from a group of young men who love and care for him while going on this quest The story has a natural drama and honest portrayal of the commitment of young people to help one of their own stricken with this incurable disease Anyone who thinks young people are self centered and narcissistic will find this movie to turn that stereotype on its head It is the power of the young people and their engagement with Darius plight that is very compelling in this documentary
1	Like his earlier film In a Glass Cage Agust Villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor This is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see The heightened drama intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical yet never steps into it In that way it pulls off an almost impossible feat to be so over the top and yet so painfully restrained to be so charged and yet so understated and even the explosives finales are virtuosic feasts of the eye Unabashed gorgeous and highly tense this film is simply superb
1	Until today I had never seen this film Its was filmed on the sets of the Old Dark House and Frankenstein and concerns a small Bavarian village where supposedly giant bats are sucking the blood of the villagers Frankly its a damn good movie that has atmosphere to spare and a cast that won t quit Lionel Atwill Dwight Frye Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas playing a character named Brettschnieder which is of interest to me since that was my great grandmother s maiden name This is a carefully modulated film that has suspense and witty one liners that slowly builds for its brief running time only going astray when about ten minutes before the end they realized they had limited time to wrap everything up From that point to the end its a straight run to the finish with very little of the fun that preceded it Leonard Maltin and IMDb list a running time of minutes and warn of shorter prints The trouble is that IMDb and Maltin can be wrong and in this case I think they are since a source I trust more says the full running time is minutes The Overlook Film Encyclopedia Quibbling about this I know is insane but since most prints that are available tend to run around minutes the amount of missing material is considerably less if its only minutes long Personally I think it won t matter that much since its at most five minutes and I doubt very much it will make or break the film What ever the running time if you like creaky old films do by all means do watch this movie its a great dark and stormy night film
0	I love B movies but come on this wasn t even worth a grade The ending was dumb b c THERE WAS NO REAL ENDING not to mention that it comes to life on its own I mean no lighting storm or crazy demonic powers Slow as hell and then they just start killing off the characters one by one in like a min time period and i won t even start on the part of the thing killing the one guy without its head and then you don t even get to see what Jigsaw even does with his so called new jigsaw puzzle Unless you have nothing better to do Id watch paint dry before Id recommend this God forsaken movie to anyone else oh and to make it even better the other movie totem you can see the guy throwing the one creature in the basement scene from the window that was funny as hell and probably the only good part of watching that waste of film
0	I dug this out and watched it tonight I honestly think it must be years since the last time I saw it I remember it being a seriously flawed film I don t remember it being THIS bad I am absolutely aghast that a project with this much potential should have been mistreated so reprehensibly Who am I to blame for this The guys who wrote and I use that word loosely the script The casting directors who so terribly miscast at least major characters in the story Only of them are among the amazing The director who clearly refused to take it seriously and kept shoving awful music on top of bad writing bad acting everywhere I LIKED the theme song but it should never have been used all the way throughout the entire film Don Black who should be ASHAMED at some of the lyrics he wrote for that music It figures that I should pull this out less than a week after re reading the comic book adaptation The first minutes of the film more or less really LESS parallel the first issue of the comic As I watched it tonight I kept wondering why was ALMOST every single detail changed Doc showing up then using his wrist watch remote control to open the safe and the sniper s bullet missing him by inches because the refractive glass were just about the only things left the same I mean if you re gonna do an adaptation WHY in God s name change EVERYTHING Once they leave Doc s HQ virtually NOTHING is as it was in the comic which given Roy Thomas I figure probably follows the book I read somewhere they actually combined elements of different novels into one movie Again WHY I ve heard it was changed because they weren t able to secure the kind of budget they wanted I look at the film and think LACK OF MONEY in NO WAY explains what I saw on the screen You know when people complain about Joel Schumacher they should really take a look at this thing The best thing I can say is I think it would make a great double feature with the BATMAN feature and probably a great triple bill with that and the FLASH GORDON All films are silly Maybe we can blame the film and TV series for this Some fans have complained over the years that Adam West s BATMAN ruined the image of comic books in the minds of generations of non comics fans I think the same could be said for Hollywood I m reminded of how many really really BAD films based on classic characters have been made over the years especially it seems to me in the late s early s Charlie Chan Fu Manchu Tarzan Buck Rogers Flash Gordon The Lone Ranger all murdered by Hollywood types who think OH comic books So you know it s supposed to be STUPID More like they re the stupid ones What a waste of potential Let me say some good things Despite the script and the directing Ron Ely is GREAT When I read a DOC SAVAGE story I don t think of the James Bama paintings I think of Ely Bill Lucking who later was a regular on THE A TEAM is terrific Eldon Quick who I ve seen somewhere else but can t recall where is terrific Paul Gleason who I absolutely HATED with a passion and a vengeance in THE BREAKFAST CLUB teachers like the one he played should be banned from ever teaching anywhere may be the best of the amazing in the film Pamela Hensley though her part was almost unrecognizable from the original story is terrific Before she let her hair down I also realized she looked a HELL of a lot like Ardala Valmar from those awful John Calkins BUCK ROGERS strips I just read the other day She s got a big nose like Ardala only not quite as pronounced The comics Ardala actually looked more like the movie Princess Aura or Cher Or maybe Streisand Take yer pick Ardala actually got plastic surgery in the George Tuska strips after she was stunning Paul Wexler funny enough I saw just last week in a GET SMART episode I wonder if he was anything like the character he was supposed to be playing I don t know because that character sure wasn t in the movie the film takes its title from

0	We can start with the wooden acting but this film is a disaster Having grown up in NY I can tell you that this film is an insult to anyone who is familiar with the community or the people I m not even a defender of the culture in any way and found this to be a Hollywoodized piece of trash to fit its own fictional ridiculous culture presentation and language that anyone who watches Seinfeld knows is inaccurate This is a colossal waste of time and even worse is not exactly interesting since the outcome is obvious and the scenes of confrontation are laughably bad Who acts this way Nobody The writer s name sounds Israeli or something of that nature but it is clear he doesn t have a clue about the subject he is writing about Looking at his bio it is shocking he lived in New York and wonder how much real connection he had with the community Even mediocre films like A Stranger Among Us are better and more closer to the truth than this dreck Reading this guy s credits it s no wonder he has written scripts on all C grade films that somehow feature stars shocking Perhaps he knows someone because this script is even below par for a bad Dolph Lundgren film
0	This series has its ups and occasional downs and the latter is the case here There s an agreeable amount of spatter with an inventive implementation of the Baby Cart s weapons but the editing film is a seriously disjointed the film making itself rougher than usual At times the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the cub who nearly gets lost early on All in all disappointment That said there s a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers This installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him
1	Kate Miller Angie Dickinson is having problems in her marriage and otherwise enough to see a psychologist When her promiscuity gets her into trouble it also involves a bystander Liz Blake Nancy Allen who becomes wrapped up in an investigation to discover the identity of a psycho killer Dressed to Kill is somewhat important historically It is one of the earlier examples of a contemporary style of thriller that as of this writing has extensions all the way through Hide and Seek It s odd then that director Brian De Palma was basically trying to crib Hitchcock For example De Palma literally lifts parts of Vertigo for Dressed to Kill s infamous museum scene Dressed to Kill s shower scenes as well as its villain and method of death have similarities to Psycho De Palma also employs a prominent score with recurrent motifs in the style of Hitchcock s favorite composer Bernard Herrmann The similarities do not end there But De Palma whether by accident or skill manages to make an oblique turn from or perhaps transcend his influence with Dressed to Kill having an attitude structure and flow that has been influential Maybe partially because of this influence Dressed to Kill is also deeply flawed when viewed at this point in time Countless subsequent directors have taken their Hitchcock like De Palma and honed it improving nearly every element so that watched now after years worth of influenced thrillers much of Dressed to Kill seems agonizingly paced structurally clunky and plot wise inept One aspect of the film that unfortunately hasn t been improved is Dressed to Kill s sex and nudity scenes Both Dickinson and Allen treat us to full frontal nudity Allen s being from a very skewed angle and De Palma has lingering shots of Dickinson s breasts strongly implicit masturbation and more visceral sex scenes than are usually found in contemporary films Quite a few scenes approach soft core porn I m no fan of prudishness quite the opposite Our culture s puritanical monogamistic sheltered attitude towards sex and nudity is disturbing to me So from my perspective it s lamentable that Dressed to Kill s emphasis on flesh and its pleasures is one of the few aspects in which others have not strongly followed suit or trumped the film Perhaps it has been desired but they have not been allowed to follow suit because of cultural controls from conservative stuffed shirts De Palma s direction of cinematography and the staging of some scenes are also good enough that it is difficult to do something in the same style better than De Palma does it He has an odd characteristic approach to close ups and he s fond of shots from interesting angles such as overhead views and James Whale like tracking across distant cutaways in the sets Of course later directors have been flashier but it s difficult to say that they ve been better Viewed for film making prowess at least the museum scene is remarkable in its ability to build very subtle tension over a dropped glove and a glance or two while following Kate through the intricately nested cubes of the Metropolitan Museum of Art On the other hand from a point of view caring about the story and especially if one is expecting to watch a thriller everything through the museum scene and slightly beyond might seem too slow and silly Because of its removal from the main genre of the film and its primary concern with directorial panache as well as cultural facts external to the film the opening seems like a not very well integrated attempt to titillate and be risqu Once the first murder occurs things improve but because of the film s eventual influence much of the improvement now seems a bit clich d and occasionally hokey The performances are mostly good although Michael Caine is underused and Dickinson has to exit sooner than we d like but the exit is necessary and very effective Dressed to Kill is at least likely to hold your interest until the end but because of facts not contained in the picture itself hasn t exactly aged well At this point it is perhaps best to watch the film primarily as a historical relic and as an example but not the best even for that era of some of De Palma s directorial flair
0	Do not be mistaken this is neither a horror nor really a film I firmly advise against watching this minute failure the only reason it merited a star was the presence of Chris Pine Nothing happens You wait patiently in the hope that there may be a flicker of a twist a hint of surprise a plot to emerge but no The characters take erratic turns of pace in their actions and yet don t have the time to develop thanks to the thrifty editors and frankly ashamed writers before returning to an idyllic and playful bring on the teen rock montage state The only thing that could have made it worse would be adding the perishable token ethnic companion Their encounters with obstacles be they human or physical are brief confusing and entirely pointless Chris Pine fights to keep himself above the surface whilst being drowned by a misery of a lightweight cast Lou Taylor Pucci couldn t be dryer if he spent the summer with Keanu Reaves combing the Navada desert Watch The Road watch days Later watch day time TV anything but this I implore you Suffer the boredom unlike you may be led to believe in the film this film is no cure

0	may contain spoilers so i watched this movie last night on LMN Lifetime Movie Network which is NOT known for showing quality movies THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL i am still amazed that i watched the entire thing as it was terrible could this movie contain any more stereotypes harping jewish mother who wants son to be a doctor catholic family with priest sons big big crucifixes in every room shown in the catholic family s house mexican whores bad guy who is really a softie at heart incredibly bad country accents GAG i was at first intrigued by the fact that i had never heard of this movie and after seeing that cheryl pollack and corin nemec were in it i decided to stay awake until am to watch it anyway the only redeeming thing about this movie is madchen amick s beauty i suppose pollack s and nemec s acting is okay but they have a horrid script to work with unlike the other reviewer who commented on the lack of texan accents the movie is supposed to take place in austin and very few people there have a twang i think that the accents were there in supporting characters like mary margaret s date and john and were unnecessary they were also very very bad i am so very tired of hollywood southern accents that sound nothing like the area where the accent is supposed to be from and since it was supposed to take place in austin and shooting movies there in would not have been expensive i fully expected there to be familiar shots of the town the beautiful capitol building the UT tower lit up for a winning football game etc none of these things were there also it takes about hours to drive to mexico from austin at one point in the movie michael and his posse take off for mexico to lose their virginities and are able to drive off when it is dark during the summer and early fall it doesn t get dark in austin until pm or so spend time in mexico getting drunk and having sex with mexican is there any other kind whores and then return to austin by dawn while this is theoretically possible it is NOT very likely and if anyone has started school in the hill country usually the third week of august but may have been in september in they know that unless they want to pass out from heat stroke they DO NOT wear their letter jackets in august and september in austin and the surrounding areas it is degrees only people with no body temperature would be stupid enough to wear sweaters or letter jackets on the first day of school all in all a very bad made for tv movie experience

0	Because cruel would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these film makers Where do you even begin In a spout of b tchiness I m going to start with the awful acting of nearly everybody in this movie Scratch that Nearly does not belong in that sentence I can t think of even one character who was portrayed well Although in all fairness it would be nearly impossible to portray these zero dimensional characters in a successful way Still the girl who played Katherine whose name I purposefully don t include I m pretending she doesn t exist remains one of the worst actors I ve ever seen only eclipsed by the guy who played Sebastian The story was God awful It attempted to mirror the brilliance that was the first one but failed in so many ways Pretty much every part of it was pointless though I will admit grudgingly that the plot twist was quite good it its surprise And the ending was at least slightly humorous But this film is up there with the worst I ve seen Don t watch it Just don t There is absolutely no value in watching it None It only takes away the enjoyment of the first
1	Good sequel to Murder in a Small Town In this one Cash and his police Lt buddy unravel a sticky plot involving a Nazi criminal a philanthropic witch and a family of screw ups and their wierdo helpers As in the original the viewer is treated to a nice little mystery with distinctive sights and sounds of pre war America Go see it
1	Warning Spoilers ahead SPOILERS I ve seen movie in German so it might be that I missed some clues Despite some weakness in the plot it s a movie that came through to me I liked especially Lexa Doig s acting Sometimes I got impression that she is Camille But I can t stop wondering what happened at the end with Bob Cassie and baby I belive she after initially being set on Bob eventually ended up loving him and regretting what happened with his brother and being forced to lie to him Otherwise it s a bit strange that she would carry his baby and love it It s up to viewer to decide and I don t like such endings Dean Cain was as good as ever Eric Roberts well I ve seen him better but also worse I believe that the film is more an analysis of human relations and reacting in unexpected situations than a crime story Bottom line is I liked it very much
0	Yes I am just going to tell you about this one so don t read if you want surprises I got this one with the title Christmas Evil There was also another Christmas horror on the DVD called Silent Night Bloody Night Whereas Silent Night Bloody Night not to be confused with Silent Night Deadly Night had lots of potential and was very close to being good this one wasn t quite as good It started out interesting enough watching the villain if you can call him that watching the neighborhood kids and writing in books about who is naughty and nice but after awhile you are looking for some action and this movie doesn t deliver You need character development but this goes overboard and you are still never sure why the heck the guy snaps About an hour in he kills three of four people while a whole crowd watches in terror and the guys he kills aren t even his targets they are just making fun of him This is one of many unsuccessful attempts by the killer to knock of the naughty He then proceeds to try and kill this other guy and he tries to break into his house by squeezing himself into the fireplace He promptly gets stuck and barely manages to get out He then enters through the basement and then tries to kill the guy by smothering him in his bedroom He can t seem to kill the guy this way so he grabs a star off the tree and slits the guys throat What the heck was a tree even doing in the bedroom in the first place Oh yeah the killer before this kill stopped off at a party and had some fun too Well that is about it except for the town people chasing him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and that tune he wants to play What was that even about He kept talking about something that was never really explained How does it end you ask well since I have spoilers I will tell you He runs off the road in his van and proceeds to well lets just say it was lame
0	I read the novel some years ago and I liked it a lot when I saw the movie I couldn t believe it They changed everything I liked about the novel even the plot I wonder what did Isabel Allende author say about the movie but I think it sucks
1	The best part of An American In Paris is the lengthy ballet sequence at the end where Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are the living personification of several major painters Kelly has earlier been established as a pavement artist in Paris so the sequence is the logical ending to a musical bursting with life and energy Gershwin tunes and cast members like Georges Guetary and Oscar Levant Kelly was at his best here it s a little different to Singin in the Rain and the effect of all the film as one topped with the ballet gives it a definite wow factor No wonder the sequence ended That s Entertainment after all other MGM musical highlights had gone by
0	I think if they made ANY MONEY make a complete turd bomb like this one The I need to get into the movie industry I wiped my ass on a piece of toilet paper and made a better script once Watch when the guy is running through the tunnel they used the same feet of tunnel OVER and OVER and OVER again and never even changed the location of the stupid HANGING light I think if i get the THRILL of meeting the director of this GEM of a MOVIE I think i will pick a fight with him and start it by deficating on his LOAFERSI think I need to puke now
1	Extremely interesting and intriguing movie The similarities to David Lynch who is even quoted literally by the presence of red curtains in the film and the novels of Franz Kafka the house keeper in this film is called Mrs Grubach as is the one in Der Prozess are clearly present but in this case are accompanied by clear references to the colonial past of Belgium in Africa The exact content of the movie I can not clearly describe this colonialism is an important part as is the inability to cope with such a past but the personal memories of the main character are a central issue as well and his quest for social contact and love These are the symbolic themes I deduced from the movie but in fact they re no more than impressions But even if you just try to follow the linear story without these symbolic backgrounds you still will discover an extremely fascinating movie filled with splendid imagery beautiful close ups of beatles larvas and other nasty insects are alternated with great dream sequences and also the dark atmosphere lends the film extra style Maybe you can say that I didn t quite get the film but I have been watching like hypnothised for hour deeply impressed by the visual quality and the fascinating mysteriosity
1	A solid if unremarkable film Matthau as Einstein was wonderful My favorite part and the only thing that would make me go out of my way to see this again was the wonderful scene with the physicists playing badmitton I loved the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for Robbins to retrieve the birdie
0	How many more of those fake slice of life movies need to be made Hopefully not too many Raising Victor Vargas is a very self conscious attempt by the director Peter Solett at garnering the attention of Hollywood Nothing wrong with that in general What is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every clich in the book of supposedly edgy Hollywood independent production It s supposed to be real so left shake the camera documentary style except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose It s edgy so let s not waste any time lighting the film It s hip so let s have the children use swear words like Al Pacino in Scarface And so on and so forth All that you are left with is a very self conscious attempt at impressing Hollywood that won t impress anyone outside of the rarefied indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film
0	Ben a out of town cop is convinced his sister was brutally killed and wants to bring her killer to justice but he s approached by Stefan who believes his sister was a victim of a werewolf cult So Ben his sister s best friend and Stefan travel to Transylvania to put a end to this evil This is incredibly awful B grade stuff and I wondered how it even got released It makes the original Howling look like a masterpiece What was Christopher Lee thinking as this has to be his worst performance I ve seen There was a lot wrong with this real cheap ass film ranging from the really hammy and wooden performances from Annie McEnroe Reb Brown Marsha A Hunt and Sybil Danning not to forgot Lee cheesy fashion those sunnies cheap and lame special effects bad use of lighting the humour if there was any trashy s music with some of the film just focusing on some unknown band playing werewolf s having orgies which is a sight to see and a tiresome story with flat and annoying dialogue I thought if it was that bad it would be awfully funny but I was wrong The positives were the location and settings of the film looked great but that s about it actually I ll add Sybil Danning short stripping scene too During the end credits the band plays their crap house song during a weird montage of scenes from the film which I beckon the question why An awful piece of mess however at least it isn t boring
0	Scarecrows is one of those films that with a little more acting a little more direction and a lot more story logic would have been quite compelling as a horror entry As it stands it is still a creepy film that has solid make up and gore effects and a premise that sustains the mood of terror in spite of itself And hey there are no teenagers getting killed one by one just dumb adults so that is a refreshing change of pace And the plot line is amazingly similar to Dead Birds with a precipitating robbery an abandoned spooky house in the middle of nowhere and demonic monsters But just like Dead Birds the adults are still witless they run around cluelessly before getting slaughtered one by one and they ignore the obvious danger In Scarecrows though we never really find out the supernatural why and that sustains the atmosphere of creepiness And like clowns scarecrows can be very creepy unless they look like Ray Bolger of course Escaping in a hijacked plane with the pilot and his daughter after a robbery netting millions a para military bunch is double crossed by one of their own a very nervous guy named Burt He jumps out of the plane with the big and heavy box that holds the money with apparently no plans as to how to move it around once he is on the ground Being the dumbest of the bunch he is murdered first But not before he happens upon the Fowler residence nestled snuggly amid lots of really creepy looking scarecrows and surrounded with a wooden fence encircled with barbed wire and lots of warnings to stay away And the weird weathervane on the roof with the pitchfork and pterodactyl should have been a warning sign too The inside of the house is also quite foreboding to us in the audience anyway Annoyingly we must listen to Burt s thoughts in voice over as he walks around and mysteriously comes across the key to the decrepit truck in the yard The way the key pops up would be enough to have my pants with me in them flying out the door Perhaps it s just me but I really enjoy watching people s lips move on screen even when they are just thinking out loud It helps to intensify the action and gives the actor more to do than just look like what the voice over is saying Burt hoists the box onto the truck and makes his getaway Sure why not decrepit trucks always have lots of gas in them especially with today s prices and the battery no problem Now I did mention that Burt was the dumbest of the bunch and here is why in addition to the above of course Wearing night vision goggles to walk through the foliage and find the house he takes them off to drive the truck away and instead turns on the headlights to see where he is going Of course the crooks still in the plane spot the headlights of his truck and know where he is headed Brilliant He deserves to die Definitely I am not sure why he needed night vision goggles in the first place as every scene is brightly lit from the interior of the plane to the night time outside scenery and the house The cinematographer was either a myopic b just out of school or c dealing with really cheap filmstock Burt meets his demise when the truck dies in the middle of nowhere Go figure One very nice touch and there are I must admit a few in the film is the fact that when he opens the truck s lid there is no engine Creepy to be sure and insert pants comment again here The story logic fails when dead now stuffed like a flounder with money and straw Burt returns to the house The rest of the bunch are there rough him up then realize that he is indeed dead and was gutted and stuffed like a flounder with money and straw Dead Burt does manage to put up quite a fight though and grabs one fellow by the mouth pushing him through a window causing him to bite off more than he could chew in a gorylicious scene At this point you would think they d would be racing out of the house and back to the plane but noooo they decide to stay and look for the rest of the money In fact the whole Burt is dead episode is treated rather matter of factly although one bright bulb in the bunch does argue Burt was walking around dead for chrissakes The stolen money suddenly appears on the grounds outside the house and the crooks blithely go for the bait Soon another one of them Jack is dispatched and again the scene is well done and horrific involving a dull handsaw and no anethesia Now there are three scarecrows going about wreaking mayhem and one of them needs a hand literally When one of the crooks sees the scarecrows and Jack getting scarecrow ized he starts screaming running away like hell and shooting off his gun in typical para military fashion So much for all that training under pressure crap He meets up with the others and stops in his tracks to explain why he is screaming running away like hell and shooting off his gun even though the scarecrows appear to be chasing him Again that script logic thing Dead and gutted Jack returns to the house and goes after the screamer with the usual results If you listen to Jack s demonic growl by the way you may notice depending on your age that it is the same monster growling sound heard often in the Lost In Space TV episodes The last two survivors race away from the house and back to the plane barely escaping But do they You will have to see the film to find out
1	Not a bad word to say about this film really I wasn t initially impressed by it but it grew on me quickly I like it a lot and I think its a shame that many people can t see past the fact that it was banned in some territories mine being one of them The film delivers in the shock gore and atmosphere department The score is a beautiful piece of suspense delivering apparatus It only seems fair that Chris Young went on to be one of the best composers in the business The acting in this film is of a somewhat high standard if a little wooden in some spots and the effects are very real and gritty All of this is high praise for a good slasher film in my book I ve noted in some reviews that the film has gotten serious flack having the famous killer s P O V shot And I ask WHAT S WRONG WITH THAT It is a classic shot that evokes dread into any good fan of the genre and is a great to keep the killer s identity a secret The only thing that stops this film getting top marks in my book is that the surprise twist killer revealed is not handled with more care I mean it just happens kind of quickly though the great performances make it just about credible Aside from that PRANKS is a great movie though I prefer the original title and its a shame that so many people knock it off as just a cheap piece of crap Its more than that but only few know that as it seems to have gotten lost in the haze of early s slasher What a shame Its a really good movie people Believe me
0	This is just flat out unwatchable If there s a story in here somewhere it s so deeply buried beneath the horrid characters and jarring camera work that s it s indiscernible There s a group of vampire hunters who go around doing their thing and the vampires they kill have little aliens inside of them They pop their heads out and talk like Speedy Gonzales If you can imagine a blood and gore covered alien sock puppet screaming in horror as a cowboy dude zaps it with a cattle prod well that s what you get here These folks are loud obnoxious violent and just extremely annoying Then there are some anti human humans who stand around in their CGI spaceship being so incredibly pompous that it s impossible to take These folks make Hillary Clinton seem like a right wing extremist in comparison They re friends with some vampires or something who cares Then there s the camera work Remember how everybody hated the thousand cuts a minute crap from the recent Rolleball remake The folks who made this movie LOVE that stuff There s enough of it in here for three really crappy nu metal videos on MTV Nuff said This thing smells In comparison Dracula is a masterwork
0	One has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film ascript existed that made any sense Was the rough cut hourslong and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives Why would anyone finance this mess I will say that TomWlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he canwith the dialogue and dramatic situations he is given Butcharacters come and go for no apparent reason continuity isnon existent and the acting cinematography and direction are toput it politely amateurish Not One Sleeps is an unfortunatechoice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyoneactually attempt to actually watch this film
1	This interesting documentary tells a remarkable tale of an expedition to take blind Tibetan children trekking in the Himalayas but also of a personality clash between two remarkable people On one hand there is Erik Weihenmeyer the first blind man to climb Everest and the team of sighted mountaineers who are guiding the kids On the other there is Sabriye Tenberken a blind woman who runs the first school for blind Tibetans who agrees to the expedition but subsequently has doubts about how it is progressing At some level Sabine simply doesn t understand the mountaineer s philosophy with it s emphasis on summitting she is probably right in identifying the mismatch between the mountaineers goals and the desires of the children but her certainty in her own correctness makes her a hard person to sympathise with especially as she has an effective veto In the background to this reasonably well mannered clash we get an insight into the lives of the children themselves I enjoyed the film although it delivers a message clearly designed to be uplifting even though it details the quarrel the film somewhat relentlessly asserts how amazing all those who feature in it are But it s hard to argue with that assessment even if it is presented to the viewer somewhat unsubtly
1	Nothing new is this tired serio comedy that wastes the talents of Danny Glover and Whoopi Goldberg Considering that this was produced by the stars and Spike Lee it s pretty tame and tired stuff And how come the Whoop never changes her hair or glasses over the many years this film covers Blah
1	The morbid Catholic writer Gerard Reve Jeroen Krabb that is homosexual alcoholic and has frequent visions of death is invited to give a lecture in the literature club of Vlissingen While in the railway station in Amsterdam he feels a non corresponded attraction to a handsome man that embarks in another train Gerard is introduced to the treasurer of the club and beautician Christine Halsslag Ren e Soutendijk who is a wealthy widow that owns the beauty shop Sphinx and they have one night stand On the next morning Gerard sees the picture of Christine s boyfriend Herman Thom Hoffman and he recognizes him as the man he saw in the train station He suggests her to bring Herman to her house to spend a couple of days together but with the secret intention of seducing the man Christine travels to K ln to bring her boyfriend and Gerard stays alone in her house He drinks whiskey and snoops her safe finding three film reels with names of men he decides to watch the footages and discover that Christine had married the three guys and all of them died in tragic accidents Later Gerard believes Christine is a witch and question whether Herman or him will be her doomed fourth husband The ambiguous The Vierde Man is another magnificent feature of Paul Verhoeven in his Dutch phase The story is supported by an excellent screenplay that uses Catholic symbols to build the tension associated to smart dialogs magnificent performance of Jeroen Krabb in the role of a disturbed alcoholic writer and stunning cinematography The inconclusive resolution is open to interpretation like in many European movies that explore the common sense and intelligence of the viewers There are mediocre directors that use front nudity of men to promote their films however Paul Verhoeven uses the nudity of Gerard Reve as part of the plot and never aggressive or seeking out sensationalism Last but not the least the androgynous beauty of the sexy Ren e Soutendijk perfectly fits to her role of a woman that attracts a gay writer My vote is eight Title Brazil O o Homem The th Man
0	This is a film that makes you say things I can do much better than this acting writing and directing this is so bad I must leave a review and warn others Looks as if it was shot with my flip video I have too believe my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me I have noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video Must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this film One of the worst movies I have ever seen hopefully the writers and director leave the business not even talented enough to do commercials
0	This movie is very much like Flashdance you know that dance flick with Jennifer Beals That film is probably the most boring film I have ever seen since it s not even bad enough to be funny G I Jane is much better than that film but that doesn t say much Here Demi Moore sweats a lot and there s high music and we get to see her fight and everything but it is certainly not very engaging I really think the idea behind the film is kind of interesting but the script is too clich d and Ridley Scott can t do anything about that Well like I said It s better than Flashdance
0	As a spiritualist and non Christian I thought i really was going to be holding onto my faith but what a load of i seers I thought the film would have great arguments but only got one sided views from Atheists and Jews And who are all these street people he s interviewing who don t know the back of their arm from their head Where are the proper theologians and priests and stuff he could have got arguments from Not retired nuts who wrote books and finished their studies in Personally this DVD was a waste of time and not worth my time to check if the facts are right or wrong or if i should or should not believe because an anti Christ told me so Please to think he came up with the conclusion of not finding God because his own ego and demons got the better of him No im not going to say the movie was stunning to help atheists reading this feel better about themselves But if you really want to show the world you care about us poor souls who believe in Jesus then entice us with your worth not your beating off the drums
1	After a long hard week behind the desk making all those dam serious decisions this movie is a great way to relax Like Wells and the original radio broadcast this movie will take you away to a land of alien humor and sci fi paraday Captain Zippo died in the great charge of the Buick He was a brave man The Jack Nicholson impressions shine right through that alien face with the dark sun glasses and leather jacket And always remember to beware of the doughnut of death Keep in mind the number one rule of this movie suspension of disbelief sit back and relax and Prepare to die Earth Scum You just have to see it for yourself
1	This film seems to get bad critiscism for some reason Probably just by the mass populace Anyhow this is actually a very interesting movie The film is an under budget sci fi movie which actually works due to an interesting storyline and well done scenes This movie may not be for everyone though If there are any Sci Fi fans reading this I truly recommend this movie if you like good ole science fiction The film has crazy ideas The setting includes nations going to war with GIGANTIC machines which the entire countries invest all it s money in The world has been divied up into territories Anyone can challenge anyone else to a war or rather a robot duel The method of warfare is cleaner than nuclear war since now everyone is wearing those breath masks Definetly a movie that makes you think Intelligent well written and good effects for the measly budget I tend to like movies which have small budgets and actually work
1	The Sarah Silverman program is very similar to Sarah s own stand up It s so over the top with prejudice that you can t possibly take it to heart The fact is though that while most all people will get it it doesn t mean they will all appreciate it It s a very polarizing and one dimensional show so if you don t like it after minutes you may as well give up there If you do like it after minutes stay tuned because every episode thus far has been as good as the last Like all shows though it is not perfect Personally I love the program but there are some huge faults with it Racist songs are funny but get older a lot faster than Silverman seems to realize a problem that I had with Jesus is Magic as well It seems as if Silverman gave herself a quota for songs per episode that doesn t need to exist Not to mention that while the lyrics to the songs she writes are good the music well isn t Another thing to keep in mind is that while this show will for some reason appeal to fans of Monty Python Upright Citizens Brigade etc it is nothing like those shows I can watch Monty Python all day but as much as I like this show I can t watch more than the half hour limit at a time It gets flat very fast The repeat value for this show is low too the second time around an episode is fairly funny and by the third time in my opinion it s boring Still that first time around is very very funny Give it a shot
0	I have not yet decided whether this will replace Anaconda as The Worst Film I Have Ever Seen Even if you ignore the dodgy accents low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it I only went to see it as I had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a hour film The simple answer is they didn t Characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative Even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches it s climax you don t care what happens to any of them I can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from But after my friends and I came out of the cinema I had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happened They even change the true meaning of the books title Rancid Aluminium by squeezing it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool title A real mess of a film from start to finish
1	I finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it It actually exceeded my expectations Considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and well made film The lack of finances actually helped this film in several ways especially given the plot Just like The Blair Witch Project this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film Another bonus Whereas most low budget horror films even the best of the best suffer from mediocre to unintentionally hysterical acting this film actually had a talented cast save one or two characters particularly the two leads The only thing missing from the film was an original storyline It borrows heavily from better known films like Deliverance and Wrong Turn but if you re like me films of this nature never cease to be terrifying Plus the director keeps things interesting throughout I d be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and I have a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out
0	OK first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the s I was shocked to find out it was released in Secondly the plot was all over the place right off the bat the story is confusing Had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would ve been better Also I appreciate fantasy but this film was too much It was bizarre and badly filmed The scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd It was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand I love Chinese epic films but if you re looking for a Chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the Promise visually stunning the plot is interesting and good character development not this film Beware you will be disappointed
0	Return to Cabin by the Lake just was lacking It must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera So within the same scene you ll have some movie quality camera shots AND simple video camera shots It makes for a very odd blend I think they should have found SOME way to not do the home video type effect I think it s worthwhile to see it IF you have seen the original CBTL because then you can compare and see the differences But if you haven t seen the original CBTL you ll never want to see it if you see this one first It will probably seem way too cheesy and turn you off from even caring about the original one
0	Absolutely one of the worst movies of all time Low production values terrible story idea bad script lackluster acting and I can t even come up with an adjective suitably descriptive for how poor Joan River s directing is I know that there s a special place in Hell for the people who financed this film prolly right below the level reserved for child raping genocidal maniacs This movie is a trainwreck Terrible x infinity Rabbit Test Avoid this at all costs It s so bad it isn t even funny how bad it is
0	Truly shows that hype is not everything Shows by and by what a crappy actor abhishek is and is only getting movies because of his dad and his wife Amitabh as always is solid Ajay Devgan as always is shitty and useless and the new guy is a joke The leading lady is such a waste of an actor Such pathetic movie from such a revered director and from such a big industry With movies as such I have decreased the amount of bollywood movies I watch RGV has been making very crappy movies for a while now Time to get different actors Hrithek anyone Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol back Every other leading lady is a half naked wanna be Pffffft
0	I picked this movie on the cover alone thinking that i was in for an adventure to the level of Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom Unfortunately I was in for a virtual yawn Not like any yawn i have had before though This yawn was so large that i could barely find anything of quality in this movie The cover described amazing special effects There were none The movie was so lightweight that even the stereotypes were awfully portrayed It does give the idea that you can solve problems with violence Good if you want to teach your kids that I don t Keep away from this one If you are looking for family entertainment then you might find something that is more inspiring elsewhere
1	A fantastic show and an unrealized classic The League of Gentlemen remains as one of the greatest modern comedies of recent times With a dark and bizarre style of humor that towers over the tired formulaic approach of it s inferior yet unfortunately far more acknowledged successor Little Britain The League of Gentlemen was truly something special during a rather quiet era in British comedy Up until it s arrival on the scene there had never really been anything like The League of Gentlemen before On the surface a seemingly simplistic sketch show the show soon unfolds as a vivid sinister but incredibly hilarious universe populated with all manner of brilliant comedic creations What really sets the show apart from it s rivals is it s approach to telling us it s story Rather than serve us re hashed sketches barely distinguishable from the next here we see each individual or group of characters go through their various journeys and story lines No visit to them is the same and each time they offer us up with a surprise Gradually over three series and a Christmas special the fictional town of Royston Vasey is heaving with a grotesque yet hilarious populace And that s probably the main reason why the show is such a joy to watch and also the reason why the show would easily merit more series Unlike other current shows like The Catherine Tate Show or more importantly Little Britain the League both know when a character has run it s course and have the opportunity to deal with that Several fan favorite s who could have easily been kept on to entertain further bowed out before the series came to a close giving room for fellow characters to grow more or allow for the introduction of newer residents of Royston Vasey to make their mark Another thing that sets this show above others is that the writing team approach the script process with care and intelligence As mentioned before all four members of the League have a sound mind when it comes to judging the longevity of their creations and when it s time to call it quits in respect to certain characters This awareness has also meant The League of Gentlemen undergoes a bold evolution not usually seen in a show of this nature The narrative driven and far darker third series is a brave step away from the more sketch based first two series and this bold move by the League really pays off With the third series there s less of an urgency for them to please an audience and like the Christmas special they pursue individual stories with a clear narrative unlike the more sketch based previous series that succesfully binded together various sets of sketches into a series long story arc The third series is both a refreshing change of pace of style as well as a real treat for fans who ve already seen the first two Despite some polarized opinion on the third series any real fan of the League will appreciate what the third series has to offer as well as really enjoy the more character based episodes that only delve deeper into fan favorite s but pair up and inter wine characters that might not have crossed paths previously It might take a little trying to get into the change in style but it s definitely worth it and in my opinion the third series is the best and also provides a firm conclusion to the series The show s not without it s drawbacks and very occasionally certain characters and set pieces appear somewhat out of place but for the most part the genius writing dark nature of the show and the host of brilliant characters that are often all too close to real life make for a real treat and prove what comedy should be about and puts much of the more recent catch phrase driven and often desperate attempts at comedy to shame
1	Who would have thought that such an obscure little film could be so haunting and touching I am really impressed It s a shame that more people have not seen it I loved as always Hans Zimmer s score And what a directorial debut by Bernard Rose Yet I wonder if I should call this a horror film It could easily be argued that it is a fantasy or a drama as well Well regardless I love the interpretive potential it has Everything and everyone in Anna s played by Charlotte Burke dreams represents a real conflict in her life the house itself the tree Mark the lighthouse etc It is the many details such as these that make the film so good for repeated viewings I hope I come across another little movie as loaded with emotion and psychological meaning as this one some time soon
0	This film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California She thought it was wonderful because it was so real Just the way people in the Ohio Valley are I m from the area and I experienced the film as Just the way people in California think we are I ve lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there We laughed a lot we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age the young people went out together at night The older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families The area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere else Aside from the if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed condescension the story lacked any elements of charm mystery or even a sense of dread Martha s character was the worst drawn It s doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church but if she had she probably would have made friends there I ve read reviews that seem to assume Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was younger prettier and thinner but if this is the case it isn t shown All we actually see is Martha learning to dislike Rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender We see Martha feeling left out during smoking sessions left out of the loop when social plans are made used but not appreciated and finally disrespected and hurt Just one more thing Are we supposed to suspect Kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks Please This takes stigma against mental illness to a new level
1	Every one should see this movie because each one of us is broken in some way and it may help us realize My life isn t as bad as I thought it was and How important it is to adopt a child in need There are so many out there To think that the movie was actually based on a real person made us think deep about life and how the world has and always will be Corrupt but that corruption doesn t have to reach your home We all have a choice Definitely recommend this one and while you re at it I d like to throw in The Color Purple and Woman Thou Art Loosed by T D Jakes These are all movies that are based on life and give us a glimpse of life
1	I remember seeing this in a the Salem movie theater where I used to attend Kiddie Matin e s almost every Saturday in Dayton Ohio when I was a young boy and have never forgotten it It simply amazed me and my friends I do wish there were some way I could see it again I have tried to find some compilation of shorts or something like that to no avail I only recently discovered that it was a Cousteau film and that blew my mind even more How the heck he accomplished this is beyond my understanding The fish is ACTUALLY IN THE CAT S MOUTH at one point if I remember correctly If anyone could help me find a way to see it again I would be extremely grateful
0	I am not so much like Love Sick as I image Finally the film express sexual relationship of Alex kik Sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness frustration and jealous at last Alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and future Ending up was sad The director Tudor Giurgiu was in AMC theatre on Sunday PM on with us watched the movie together After the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of Romanian were kind of complicate On my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere I don t feel any particular impression and effect from the movie The love proceeding of Alex and Kiki and Kiki and her brother Sandu were kind of next door neighborhood story The two main reasons I don t like this movie are firstly the film didn t told us how they started to fall in love Sounds like after Alex moved into the building which Kiki was living then two girls are fall in love It doesn t make sense at all How a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man Too much fragments you need to image and connect those stories by your mind Secondly The whole film didn t have a scene of Alex and Kik s sexual intercourse that s what I was waiting for However it still had some parts were deserved to recommend The ear piercing part was kind of interesting Alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kik s love That was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love Also the scene of they were lying in the soccer field the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate
0	A plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side pro life and the other a destroyer of a demon s seed The horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific but instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death despite the title itself Being a fan of Masters of Horror since the beginning this ridiculous plot twist with it s sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon I view this episode as being thrown together from the get go never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to The End
1	Not many movies were made about the Lighter Than Air LTA aspect of aviation but this is one of them and it s damn good Just a fun film to watch Most of the movie takes place at the Navy blimp operations at NAS Lakehurst with NAS Tustin playing the role Wallace Beery plays a likable but Munchausen like Senior Chief Ned Trumpet an enlisted pilot whose tall tales have gotten so frequent nobody really believes him Half the fun is near the end of the movie when events start proving that most of his more outlandish tales are actually true Set during WWII the main plot centers around bachelor Trumpet wooing a local widow only to end up having a father son relationship with the widow s crippled son Jess Told he would never walk without crutches by doctors Chief Trumpet pulls some strings and a Navy flight surgeon helps in restoring the lad s crippled leg Jess goes on to join the Navy to become a flight officer flying blimps back at Lakehurst and facing a whole new set of challenges A very well done movie albeit not without some corny Hollywood dialogue slipping past the technical advisers and Beery s apparent inability to march in step Otherwise this movie gets good grades for technical accuracy and gives a rare look into the Navy s LTA operations The Cash Register Scene an exchange between Trumpet and Jess s future love interest Cathy is an absolute hoot
1	Sniper gives a true new meaning to war movies I remember movies about Vietnam or WWII lots of firing everybody dies bam bam Sniper takes war to a new level or refinement The movie certainly conveys all of the emotions it aims for The helplessness of humans in the jungle the hatred and eventual trust between Beckett and Miller and the rush of the moment when they pull the trigger A seemingly low budget film makes up for every flaw with action suspense and thrill because when it comes down to it it s just one shot one kill
0	This is the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen quite a few movies It is passed off as an art film but it is really a piece of trash It s one redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dancing but that cannot make up for Sally Potter s disgustingly obvious tribute to herself The plot of this movie is nonexistent and I guarantee you will start laughing by the end Especially where she starts singing It s absolutely unreal
0	This wasn t the major disaster that I was expecting but that is about as positive as I can be in my description of the movie I m not sure what was meant to be funny about this movie but I suppose it s all a matter of taste Personally I don t find it funny to watch morons living their idiotic lives or making fools of themselves on television but then again I m not a fan of Jerry Springer s pathetic daytime talk show I didn t get too bored watching this but I was definitely never enjoying it either If you re in the mood to see a bad movie but one that isn t too painful to sit through this is a good choice
0	I did not watch the entire movie I could not watch the entire movie I stopped the DVD after watching for half an hour and I suggest anyone thinking of watching themselves it stop themselves before taking the disc out of the case I like Mafia movies both tragic and comic but Corky Romano can only be described as a tragic attempt at a mafia comedy The problem is Corky Romano simply tries too hard to get the audience to laugh the plot seems to be an excuse for moving Chris Kattan Corky from one scene to another Corky himself is completely overplayed and lacks subtlety or credulity all his strange mannerisms come across as contrived Chris Kattan is clearly acting rather than taking a role it bounces you right out of the story Each scene is utterly predictable the comedic event that will occur on the set is obvious as soon as each scene is introduced In comedies such as Mr Bean the disasters caused by the title character are funny because you can empathise with the characters motivations and initial event and the situation the character ends up in is not telegraphed Corky however gives the feeling that he is deliberately screwing up in a desperate attempt to draw a laugh from the audience If Chris had not played such an alien character who never really connects with the other characters in the movie and whose behaviour is entirely inexplicable except for trying to draw laughs and the comedy scenes weren t so predictable and stereotyped all the jokes seemed far too familiar this movie could have been watchable But it isn t Don t watch it
0	Lame movie Completely uninteresting No chemistry at all between Indiana Jones and the guy from Black Hawk Down The car chase scene just goes on and on and on ad nauseum They manage to switch vehicles a few times but always end up right on the tail of the baddies The scene where Hartnett grabs the family s car with the crying kids in the back was just as stupid as could be He is telling them about Eastern philosophy and how it is all right to die which I imagine the writers thought was funny or even witty It just came off as moronic totally unbelievable and even cruel Some subplots weren t even explored they were just used as filler Why does Hartnett get sick seeing dead bodies yet keeps ordering burgers at crime scenes Why and on what grounds is the bad IA guy suddenly arrested out of the blue by the chief Why can IA pick up the buddy cops and then just let them answer their phones or pretend to be Indian mystics and then just let them waltz out of there without so much as a slap on the wrist For some reason even though Ford is uncovered as a cheat and a fraud when acting as a realtor he makes up the prices when he is trying to sell the producer s house to jack up his own commission they keep coming back to him anyway They knew he lied to both of them Yet there they were coming to terms that both said they would never go for Stupid just stupid This is also one of those cop movies where they just fire wantonly on public streets with no care in the world for innocent bystanders There they were just standing on the sidewalk blasting away while people ducked for cover Amazing that they didn t hit a single person after having fired about rounds each The scriptwriting was terrible the action sequences were boring the plot just a sidestory to a very pathetic attempt to have us root for Ford and Hartnett It fails miserably And Ford s phone Turn the damn thing off How many times could it ring in a hour movie It was frustratingly aggravating by the midpoint in the movie Every seconds that stupid tune would play And if it wasn t Ford s then Hartnett s was ringing It was incredibly annoying Complete waste of time Ford s worst movie since Days Nights which was without a doubt the lowest point of his distinguished career
1	A terrorist attempts to steal a top secret biological weapon and in the process of trying to escape he is infected when the case containing the deadly agent is compromised Soldiers are able to retrieve the case but the terrorist makes his way to a hotel where he attempts to hide out They eventually make it to where he s hiding and cleanse the hotel and its occupants Unfortunately they dispose of his body by cremation and if you ve seen Return of the Living Dead you know what happens next Zombi has been widely panned by critics and zombie fans alike as a complete mess of a movie While that s a fair assessment it s not without it s high points For one thing it has plenty of bloody deaths to keep gore hounds happy There s an abundance of zombies that seem to come out from everywhere possible They re in the water the rafters of houses hiding in trees and for some reason they like to hide under a bunch of dead brush only to spring out to attack as the heroes try to escape There s even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator You have to see it to believe it as that scene alone makes Zombi required viewing IMO It may have some terrible editing and some very questionable acting especially from the doctor who has to be one of the worst actors I ve seen but Zombie is still a very entertaining movie Sometimes it s nice to sit back and watch a movie that doesn t require anything more than your time and an open mind Zombi fits that bill and then some It s even more enjoyable if you pop open a few beers and watch it with some like minded friends I give it an just because of sheer enjoyment
1	As I understand it after the Chinese took over Hong Kong the infamous Cat Hong Kong movies kind of disappeared At least until now and what an amazing movie this one is I knew it was a rough crime drama going in but being the first Cat I ve purchased that s been made recently I wasn t sure what to expect A Cambodian hit man goes to Hong Kong to knock off the wife of a judge who is also a lawyer Turns out the Judge made the arrangements for the hit man because she was divorcing the judge and threatening to take all his money This is all known within the first ten minutes so nothing is being given away After the hit the cops locate the hit man pretty fast but in trying to arrest him several police officers and civilians are killed He eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy before he escapes back to Cambodia This is a movie that never stops and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath Yes it is very violent and intense many cops are killed as the hit man proves very very hard to track and take down when they do locate him Along the way the hit man in trying to hide in a dump finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man He helps her and saves her from the guy and she persuades the hit man to take her along with him in his escape I loved this movie it s like a roller coaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed as one incident leads to another and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hit man The acting is exceptionally good and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking There s no let up in this movie not even with the very very incredible ending The ending is pretty much unbelievable and also a fitting end to all the action and violence Yes the violence is brutal at times but this is a very no nonsense crime drama that will knock your socks off Dog Eat Dog definitely needs a more widespread release including an R release for sure Great movie highly recommended
1	Hundstage is an intentionally ugly and unnerving study of life in a particularly dreary suburb of Vienna It comes from former documentary director Ulrich Seidl who adopts a very documentary like approach to the material However the film veers away from normal types and presents us with characters that are best described as extremes some are extremely lonely some extremely violent some extremely weird some extremely devious some extremely frustrated and misunderstood and so on The film combines several near plot less episodes which intertwine from time to time each following the characters over a couple of days during a sweltering Viennese summer Very few viewers will come away from the film feeling entertained the intention is to point up the many things that are wrong with people the many ills that plague our society in general It is a thought provoking film and its conclusions are pretty damning on the whole A fussy old widower fantasises about his elderly cleaning lady and wants her to perform a striptease for him while wearing his deceased wife s clothes A nightclub dancer contends with the perpetually jealous and violent behaviour of her boy racer boyfriend A couple grieving over their dead daughter can no longer communicate with each other and seek solace by having sex with other people An abusive man mistreats his woman but she forgives him time and again A security salesman desperately tries to find the culprit behind some vandalism on a work site but ends up picking on an innocent scapegoat And a mentally ill woman keeps hitching rides with strangers and insulting them until they throw her out of the car The lives of these disparate characters converge over several days during an intense summer heat wave The despair in the film is palpable Many scenes are characterised by long awkward silences that are twice as effective as a whole passage of dialogue might be Then there are other scenes during which the dialogue and on screen events leave you reeling In particular a scene during which the security salesman leaves the female hitch hiker to the mercy of a vengeful guy to be beaten raped and humiliated thankfully all off screen for some vandalism she didn t even do arouses a sour almost angry taste In another scene a man has a lit candle wedged in his rear end and is forced to sing the national anthem at gunpoint all as part of his punishment for being nasty to his wife While we might want to cheer that this thug is receiving his come uppance we are simultaneously left appalled and unnerved by the nature of his punishment Indeed such stark contrasts could act as a summary of the whole film every moment of light heartedness is counter balanced with a moment of coldness Every shred of hope is countered with a sense of despair For every character you could like or feel sympathy for there is another that encourages nothing but anger and hate We might want to turn away from Hundstage to dismiss it as an exercise in misery but it also points up some uncomfortable truths and for that it should be applauded
0	This is a dry and sterile feature filming on one of most interesting events in WWII and in history of warfare behind the front line Bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing Hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event There is no character development at all and idea that Tom Cruise suppose to play a high rank commander that questions his deepest inner thoughts on patriotism and treason is completely insane I believe that Mister Bin would play it better Generally speaking film pretty much looks as a cheep copy of good German TV movie Stauffenberg from but can t get close to that film regarding any movie aspect whatsoever However movie obviously gets its financial goal with pop corn audience that cherishes Hollywood fast mood blood and shallow art values
0	This is a weak film with a troubled history of cuts and re naming It doesn t work at all Firstly the dramaturgy is all wrong It s very slow moving at first and then hastily and unsatisfactorily moves to an end But there is also and that may have to do with the cuts an uneasy moving between genres It starts off with being a thriller to be taken at face value and then degenerates into a farce rather than satire the ending may be funny but it s also so blunt that I almost felt it insulted my intelligence what little there is So the film tries to be everything but does not really succeed on any level at all You can also see that in the very unsteady character development You almost get the impression Connery plays three roles rather than one
1	I saw The Glacier Fox in the theatre when I was nine years old I bugged my parents to take me back three times I began looking for it on video about five years ago finally uncovering a copy on an online auction site but I would love to see it either picked up by a new distributor and rereleased I understand the original video run was small or have the rights purchased by The Family Channel Disney etc and shown regularly It is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of a family of foxes in northern Japan narrated by a wise old tree The excellent soundtrack compliments the film well It would be a good seller today better than many of the weak offerings to children s movies today
1	Bo Derek s beauty and John Derek s revolutionary direction make this film worthwhile Bo looking more gorgeous than ever is a recently widowed woman who is experiencing visitations from her dead husband Anthony Quinn He has a plan Bo must procure the body of a young man so that her ghost of a husband can make his transformation from spectre back to corporeal life Can she find a fitting candidate How will she do him in so Tony can do his thing With Bo s attributes John s unique direction Quinn s film presence and thanks to John a very pretty exotic look to the entire film this movie is pleasant viewing
1	Enjoyable movie although I think it had the potential to be even better if it had more depth to it It is a mystery halfway through the film as to knowing why Elly is such a recluse Then when we are finally given an explanation going back to her childhood there still isn t much detail Perhaps had they shown flashbacks or something Anyway it is still a good movie that I d watch again
1	Mr Harvey Lights a Candle is anchored by a brilliant performance by Timothy Spall While we can predict that his titular morose up tight teacher will have some sort of break down or catharsis based on some deep down secret from his past how his emotions are unveiled is surprising Spall s range of feelings conveyed is quite moving and more than he usually gets to portray as part of the Mike Leigh repertory While an expected boring school bus trip has only been used for comic purposes such as on The Simpsons this central situation of a visit to Salisbury Cathedral in Rhidian Brook s script is well contained and structured for dramatic purposes and is almost formally divided into acts We re introduced to the urban British range of racially and religiously diverse kids with their uniforms I couldn t tell if this is a private or public school as they gather the rapping black kids the serious South Asians and Muslims the white bullies and mean girls but conveyed quite naturally and individually The young actors some of whom I recognized from British TV such as Shameless were exuberant in representing the usual range of junior high social pressures Celia Imrie puts more warmth into the supervisor s role than the martinets she usually has to play A break in the trip leads to a transformative crisis for some while others remain amusingly oblivious We think like the teacher portrayed by Ben Miles of Coupling that we will be spoon fed a didactic lesson about religious tolerance but it s much more about faith in people as well as God which is why the BBC showed it in England at Easter time and BBC America showed it in the U S over Christmas Nathalie Press who was also so good in Summer of Love has a key role in Mr Harvey s redemption that could have been played for movie of the week preaching but is touching as they reach out to each other in an unexpected way unfortunately I saw their intense scene interrupted by commercials While it is a bit heavy handed in several times pointedly calling this road trip a pilgrimage this quiet film was the best evocation of good will towards men than I ve seen in most holiday themed TV movies
1	Worry not Disney fans this special edition DVD of the beloved Cinderella won t turn into a pumpkin at the strike of midnight One of the most enduring animated films of all time the Disney fide adaptation of the gory Brothers Grimm fairy tale became a classic in its own right thanks to some memorable tunes including A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo and the title song and some endearingly cute comic relief The famous slipper click for larger image We all know the story the wicked stepmother and stepsisters simply won t have it this uppity Cinderella thinking she s going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart but perseverance animal buddies and a well timed entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right There are a few striking sequences of pure animation for example Cinderella is reflected in bubbles drifting through the air and the design is rich and evocative throughout It s a simple story padded here agreeably with comic business particularly Cinderella s rodent pals dressed up conspicuously like the dwarf sidekicks of another famous Disney heroine and their misadventures with a wretched cat named Lucifer There s also much harrumphing and exposition spouting by the King and the Grand Duke It s a much simpler and more graceful work than the more frenetically paced animated films of today which makes it simultaneously quaint and highly gratifying
0	Cavemen was by far the biggest load of crap I have ever wasted my time watching This show based on the Geico commercials is less entertaining then an actual sec ad for Geico The makeup was half ass ed to say the least hard to imagine a caveman with prefect white teeth even after going to the dentist This show could of had potential for a funny series if they could of gotten the cast from the commercials that in it self makes for a lousy show Perhaps if the writers were the same from the Geico ads this may of had a chance instead the pilot lacked a good story line I give this show a out of I would of liked to put a zero out of but that was not an option I pray for a quick death to this show I d give it less then episodes before it dies a deserving death
1	Another very good Mann flick thanks to the father son combination of Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart Brennan Ben Tatum is often the comedic conscience of either Stewart or Wayne Red River Rio Bravo He s there to see that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend You re wrong Mr Dunston Jeff Webster Stewart gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he cannot desert Brennan John McIntire is excellent as the law of Skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it Another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people The loner can do neither and suffers for it The caption above plays on Tatum s assertion that he can t live without his coffee This nicotine addiction proves fatal Probably the first and last time on the screen I recommend this film and now own the DVD
0	I had a video of the thing And I think it was my fourth attempt that I managed to watch the whole film without drifting off to sleep It s slow moving and the idea of a mid Atlantic platform which may have been revolutionary at the time is now just a great big yawnaroony Apart from Conrad Veidt the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting When the water started to spill big time it even on one occasion woke me up But give the man his due No one could hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt He doesn t wedge it between his index and middle fingers like the lesser mortals He holds it in his fingers while showing us the old pearly browns There are a few scenes in this film where the smoke drifts up to heaven against a dark background and looks very artistically done But it does not say much about this film if all that impresses you is the tobacco smoke
0	movie goers avoid watching this movie if you are faint hearted you might want to commit suicide if you are a short tempered you would want to kill the lead performer of the movie Though he does not have any talent in acting he is the mass hero for all the rickshaw pullers auto rickshaw drivers rowdies thugs and immature and ignorant literates he proves you do not need neither talent nor knowledge to be successfully He is the highest paid actor in India That shows the taste of movie going public in India of movie goers in tamil nadu are definitely attracted to his kind of nonsense movies
0	This film lacked something I couldn t put my finger on at first charisma on the part of the leading actress This inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man Even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play It could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors I just don t know But could it have been the screenplay Just exactly who was the chef in love with He seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits than of anybody or anything else He never convinced me he was in love with the princess I was disappointed in this movie But don t forget it was nominated for an Oscar so judge for yourself
1	Indian Summer It was very nostalgic for me I found it funny heartwarming and absolutely loved it Anyone who went to camp as a kid and wishes at times they could go back to the good Ole days for a brief time really needs to see this one It starts out as years later a group of old campers returns for a reunion I won t comment on the plot anymore cause you have to see it for yourself The actors were great and it contains an all star cast Everyone in it played a terrific role You actually felt like you were a part of the movie watching it Alan Arkin was especially good in his role as Uncle Lou He plays the kind of guy that everyone wishes they had in their lives This is also a good family movie for the most part I would suggest this one to anybody in a heartbeat HIGHLY Recommended
0	Laid up and drugged out as a kidney stone wended its merry way through my scarred urinary tract with absolutely nothing better to do than let the painkillers swoon me into semi oblivion I happened to catch this movie on cable I wouldn t want anyone to think that I paid to view it in a cinema or rented it or heaven forfend that I watched it STRAIGHT Having played this sensationally gruesome video game and avidly trod the doomed rooms and dread passageways of The House battling Chariot Type The Hanged Man Type and other impossible sentinels my curiosity was piqued as to how the game would transfer to the movie screen It doesn t The banal plot revolves around a group of crazy kids a la Scooby Doo attending a remote island for a world shaking rave whatever that is You kids today with your hula hoops and your mini skirts and your Pat Boone After bribing a boat captain thousands in cash to ferry them there a stupidity which begs its own network of rhetoric they find the rave deserted Passing mention is made of a house presumably the titular House Of The Dead but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and other locales divorced from any semblance of haunted residence A fallen video camera acts as flashback filler showing the island in the throes of a party Is that it Oh so this rave thingy is just a party In the grand tradition of re euphemizing used cars as pre owned or shell shock as post traumatic stress disorder the word party is now too square for you drug addled silicone implanted metrosexual jagoffs It is learned that the party was broken up by rampaging zombies Intelligent thought stops here I don t think the pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the mythos behind zombie re animation Zombies can t die they re already UN DEAD They do not bleed they know no pain Unless their bodies are completely annihilated they will continue being animated At least that s what my Jamaican witch priestess tells me Which means that a shot into their hearts is not going to stop them nor will a machete to the torso And a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly NOT bring forth gouts of blood At least in the video game s logic the shooter pumps so many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated leaving a fetid mush that cannot re animate itself Yet each actor slash model gets their Matrix circular camera moment slaying zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum Seriously these zombies are more ineffective than the Stormtroopers from Return Of The Jedi who get knocked out when Ewoks trip them I suppose the film s writer Mark Altman having penned the not too shabby Free Enterprise felt compelled to insert a Captain Kirk reference in the character of Jurgen Prochnow who must have needed milk money desperately to have succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dung swill There is also a reference to Prochnow s primo role in the magnificent Das Boot when one of the untrained B actors mentions that he looks like a U Boat Captain I wonder how many of this movie s target audience of square eyed swine picked up on ANY of the snide references to other films as when Prochnow declares Say hello to my little friend presaging his machine gun moment Aimed at a demographic who have not the wherewithal to comprehend the Sisyphean futility of the video game concept i e the game ends when you die you cannot win this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart Accordingly everyone dies in due course except for a heterosexual pair of Attractive White People A better use for this film s scant yet misused budget might have been to send the cast through Acting School although Ona Grauer s left breast did a good job as did her right breast and those slomo running scenes priceless I especially liked the final scene with Ona trying to act like she s been stabbed but looking like she s just eaten ice cream too fast Attempting to do something more constructive with my time I pulled out my Digitally Restored th Anniversary Special Edition Widescreen Anamorphic DVD of Manos The Hands Of Fate Ah yes the drugs were suitably brain numbing now HERE was some quality film making Movie Maniacs visit www poffysmoviemania com

1	Famous words of foreign nightclub owner Roman Maroni that lousy cork sucker who spends the whole movie not only as Johnny Dangerously s rival but butchering the English language as well Another underrated classic that you can only find on afternoon matin es or Late Late Late Show s Johnny Dangerously is a terrific satirical hit about a good hearted boy who secretly leads a life of crime to help pay for his mother s medical care and put his brother through law school Yes there s a story but who cares A cast that includes Joe Piscopo Dom DeLuise Marilu Henner and Alan Hale Jr will keep you waiting to see what happens next There s too many laughs in this to put on here Like Airplane you have to pay attention or you ll miss something Highly recommended to anyone who can use a good laugh or two
1	At the time I recall being quite startled and amused by this movie I referred to it as the most important movie I d seen in ten years and found myself bumping into people who said similar things Bernhard has an unusually perceptive behavioral notebook And she has shaped the bitter adolescent personality that we all had into a corrosive adult world view The two together provide a startling mix which may be too edgy for some viewers Hi Skip I wish you weren t my brother so I could you Bernhards search for herself after returning to LA from New York results in the immersive trying on of various personas all of which fit poorly for our amusement but enough of them involve acting out to appeal to a black imperative values system that the real barometer of her resituation is whether black culture accepts her It s been a while Nina Simone comes to mind And she has an impressive solidly built black lover in the movie A pretty black girl attends the shows and seems to be authorizing Sandra s faux blackness but ultimately rejects her Just as Catholics deem themselves lucky to suffer for Christ here Sandra depicts herself suffering at the hands of a black culture in which she craves a place as if she cherishes her worthiness and her rejection It s the only value system implicated in the films world outside of Bernhards arty confusion For a nation whose chief issues are racism and money it s refreshing to see one of the topics dealt with in an atypical way
1	Funny Sad Charming These are all words that floated through my head while I was watching this beautiful simple film It is rare that a movie truly moves me but Shall We Dance accomplished that with grace to spare Gentle humor mixed in with occasional subtle agony made this easily one of the best experiences of my movie viewing history It left me with a quiet sense of exultation but with a small touch of sadness mixed in And the dancing oh yes the dancing Even if you are not a lover of the art or can t put one foot in front of another the steps displayed here will take your breath away and make you want to sign up for classes as fast as you can It was absolutely enchanting even the parts that show Sugiyama s touchingly portrayed by Koji Yakusho stilted steps when he was first learning to dance were lovely in a humorous child like way And yet this film was not entirely about dancing but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings We witness a shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance a beautiful dance instructor rediscovering her love for the art and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting cast Beauty Pain Emotion All the love and little agonies of life are here expressed with the delicate feeling of a fine Japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of the culture
0	Man was I disappointed Adam Arkin is more whiny than Ross Geller from Friends A great cast is wasted Kenneth Mars Alan Arkin Ed McMahon Pat Morita Louis Nye with this amateurish script The movie suffers from horrible pacing It jumps around through in a jumbled confusing manner The story doesn t even make sense Why does he want to break the football streak What about the stupid violin music None of it is explained It s not even funny It s like a bunch of accountants trying to do improv saying Lookit me Lookit me I m being funny This was a bad attempt at making another Love At First Bite I like Larry Cohen movies but man he failed here I couldn t wait for the credits to roll Horribly disappointed
0	I just finished watching this movie and I found it was basically just not funny at all I m an RPG Gamer computer type none of the DnD tabletop stuff but I found none of the jokes in this funny at all Some of the scenes seemed to drag out a lot tilt and zoom could ve been cut down to seconds rather than over a minute and it feels as though the director was just trying to fill in time I think I laughed a total of times in the entire movie The acting itself wasn t all that bad around the standard that a B Grade movie should have I d suggest not bothering with this movie unless you re a huge DnD fan and even then it would probably be best to steer clear of it
0	There are some good things about the movie The music and cinematography is great Alex Wilson is hot and gives a great performance Ryan Bauer is also hot The production was very lucky to have casted them because they really give production value to the movie Jonny Vincent Sean and a lot of the boys in the movie that don t speak are cute too Why isn t the actress who plays Amy listed in the credits Brandon Alexander gives a great comedic performance as Clitarissa Pink The worse thing about the movie is probably the star James Townsend He can t act He s also very scrawny not nice to look at at all His arms are like spaghetti It s disgusting They have no muscle tone at all It s no wonder he has to make his own movie and cast himself in it No one else would cast him in anything James Townsend is not believable as someone who would even have a girlfriend because he acts so gay They should have casted someone else as the lead if they wanted what s best for the movie Then again maybe he just wants to use this movie as a vehicle to launch a career in soft core porn definitely not real acting because he would have taken some acting lessons Plus anyone who does porn is blacklisted in Hollywood The most ridiculous thing about the movie is probably the casting of a tan skinned Latina as Devon s mother Sonja Fisher does not seem like an actress at all All in all this movie is soft core porn and is no better than something you would see on Skinemax I think even Alex Wilson probably the best thing about this movie is embarrassed by it and doesn t want to be associated with it There is no photo on his IMDb page and nothing else listed so Alex Wilson is probably a disposable stage name Plus I ran into him in West Hollywood one time recently and when I mentioned this movie he just turned around and walked away I understand If I had worked on this movie I would be embarrassed and wouldn t want to be associated with it either
1	Vampires sexy guys guns and some blood Who could ask for more Moon Child delivers it all in one nicely packaged flick Gackt is the innocent Sho who befriends a Vampire Kei HYDE their relationship grows with time but as Sho ages Kei s immortality breaks his heart It doesn t help that they both fall in love with the same woman The special effects are pretty good considering the small budget It s a touching story ripe with human emotions You will laugh cry laugh then cry some more Even if you are not a fan of their music SEE THIS FILM It works great as a stand alone Vampire movie out of
1	I saw Jack Frost for at my local store and I thought it looks pretty good for a low budget movie so I bought it and I was right it was good For starters this film is about a killer snowman so that s something to laugh about and the way it looks was funny compared to the Snowman on the cover The acting was okay and the lines Jack Frost said had me laughing I only axed you for a smoke and Worlds most pi ed off snow cone how funny and camp is that The tale at the start was pretty funny and silly too Jack be nimble Jack be quick Jack gouged eyes with candle sticks If you re looking for a for a B Movie Comedy horror that s full of puns then check Jack Frost out
1	Back when musicals weren t showcases for choreographers we had wonderful movies such as this one Being a big fan of both Wodehouse and Fred Astaire I was delighted to finally see this movie Not quite a blend of Wodehouse and Hollywood but close enough Some of the American vaudeville humour the slapstick not the witty banter clash with Wodehouse s British sense of humour But on the whole the American style banter makes the American characters seem real rather than cardboard caricatures Some inventive staging for the dance numbers including the wonderful fairground with revolving floors and funhouse mirrors more than make up for the lack of a Busby Berkley over the top dance number They seem a lot more realistic if you could ever imagine people starting to sing and dance as realistic The lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore don t hurt the movie instead they allow different character dynamics to emerge It s also nice not to have a wise cracking headstrong love interest Instead we have a gentle headstrong love interest far more in keeping with Wodehouses young aristocratic females
1	When I first saw the Romeo Division last spring my first reaction was BRILLIANT However on future viewings I was provided with much more than masterful film making This picture has a singular voice that will echo throughout the annuls of film history The opening montage provides a splendid palette which helmer JP Sarro uses to establish his art on this canvas of entertainment Sarro truly uses the camera as his paintbrush while he brings us along on a ride that envelops the audience in a tremendous action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we have become accustomed to and dives deeply into dark themes of betrayal revenge and the importance of companionship This movie is any director s dream at its very core However Sarro was not alone in this epic undertaking The writing provided by scribe Tim Sheridan was just as breathtaking The dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen Specifically speaking the final scene WARNING SPOILERS SPOILERS where Vanessa reveals herself to be one of the coalition and a villain all the time is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the most chilling endings I have ever seen Sheridan is the next Robert Towne In a final note it is obvious that this production was no small feat Therefore much praise must be given to producer Scott Shipley who seems to have the creativity and genius to walk next to Jerry Bruckheimer Never before have I witnessed a production so grand with so much attention directed at every little detail A producers job is one of the hardest in any movie and Shipley makes it look easy All in all this film combines creative writing stunning production and masterful direction This is the art of film at its best When the ending of the film arrives the only thing that is desired is more The Romeo Division is groundbreaking a masterpiece and most importantly The Romeo Division is indeed art
0	Based on Ray Russell s dark bestseller this John WATCHER IN THE WOODS Hough directed bust has little going for it Though it does not lack gory violence it lack narrative sensibility and characters The Incubus of the title is a demon endowed with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into vaginas during intercourse or to be more precise rape John Cassavetes moonlighting from his successful directing career is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young women Horrific possibilities of the victims spawning demonic offspring are not considered and neither is the audience s tolerance for slow moving garbage The script s reluctance to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise exemplifies the major problems with this vapid Big Schlong On The Loose exercise
0	I stopped watching this POS as soon as the snakes started taking over the plane At first I thought maybe it should get a one for the comic relief But then I realized I could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more Whatever respect I might have had for Samuel Jackson has been irreversibly destroyed And Hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are When I was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun The only thing snakes would do is huddle at the bottom of the cargo bay And no amount of Hollywood cartoon snakes can change that This movie isn t worth a trip to Blockbuster Be warned if you pay for it the only victim is your dumb ass If you want to be really scared I suggest the Descent If you want humor go to your local stand up comedy club Their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash
1	I believe a lot of people down rated the movie NOT because of the lack of quality But it did not follow the standard Hollywood formula Some of the conflicts are not resolved The ending is just a little too real for others but the journey the rich characters and long list of supporters provide is both thought provoking and very entertaining Even the cinematography is excellent given the urban setting the directing also is excellent and innovative This is a in my book this movie will take you places the normal and expected Hollywood script will not They took some risks and did a few things different I think it worked well I am purposely trying to avoid any direct references to the movie because seeing it for yourself is the best answer not accepting someone else s interpretation
1	There s some very clever humour in this film which is both a parody of and a tribute to actors However after a while it just seems an exercise in style notwithstanding great gags such as Balasko continuing the part of Dussolier and very good acting by all involved and I was wondering why Blier made this film All is revealed in the ending when Blier directing Claude Brasseur gets a phone call from his dad Bernard Blier from heaven and gets the chance to say how much he misses him An effective emotional capper and obviously heartfelt But there isn t really sufficient dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the film interesting throughout it s entire running time Some really nice scenes and sequences however and anyone who likes these mosntres sacr s of the French cinema should get a fair amount of enjoyment out of this film
0	Really bad shot on video film made by not one not two but three amateur video makers If you re going to make a bad horror film at least throw in some blood gore and nudity There is some blood provided by latex cut off arm props bought at a Halloween store There are lesbians and hookers but no nudity or sex The lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but only talking There seems to be no editing effects fades wipes etc Once in a while a bit of black appears to separate scenes Terrible music by bad heavy metal bands whose websites take up the majority of the end credits The werewolves are represented by rubber masks that are attached to just the actors face They didn t even bother to apply brown makeup to their necks arms or wrists I guarantee a year old with a video camera could put together a better movie No reason at all to buy rent or watch this film except as an example of how not to make a low budget video
1	You know the people in the movie are in for it when king sized hailstones fall from a clear blue sky In fact the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller and only lawyer Chamberlain has the answer But he s too much the European rationalist I gather to get in touch with that inner being that only reveals itself through dreams Darkly original mystery heavy on the metaphysics from director writer Peter Weir Already he had proved his skill at flirting with other dimensions in Picnic at Hanging Rock Here it s the arcane world of the Australian Aborigines that confronts that the tightly ordered world of the predominant whites Something strange is going on inside the Aborigine community when they kill one of their number for no apparent reason Yuppie lawyer Chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white man s court But the more he looks into things the more mysterious things get and the more interested a strange old Aboriginal man gets in him And then there re those scary dreams that come and go at odd times Well structured screenplay deepens interest throughout One reason the movie works is the background normalcy of Chamberlain s wife and little daughters Audiences can readily identify with them And when their little world runs into forces beyond the usual framework the normalcy begins to buckle and we get the feeling of worlds beginning to collide Chamberlain underplays throughout especially during the underground discovery tour where I think he should have shown more growing awareness than he does After all it s the picking up of the mask that holds the key I believe to the riddle yet his reaction doesn t really register the revelation Of course the notion of nature striking back has a certain resonance now thirty years later In the film the notion is wrapped in a lot of entertaining hocus pocus but the subject itself remains a telling one One way of bringing out a central irony in the movie is the symbolism of the opening scene A big white SUV barrels past an aboriginal family leaving them in the historical dust The terrain looks like an interior tribal reservation of no particular importance to the coastal fleshpots where industry dwells Yet it s also a region most likely to survive anything like a destructive last wave Perhaps there s something about past and future to think about here Anyway this is a really good movie that will probably stay with you
1	When I heard Patrick Swayze was finally returning to his acting career with KING SOLOMON S MINES I was very excited I was expecting a great Indiana Jones type action adventure What I got was a hour long with commercials epic that was very slow The second and third hour could have been dropped altogether and the story would not have suffered for it The ending was good no spoilers here but I was still left wanting more Well all a guy can do is prey that Swayze does RoadHouse so he can get back into the action genre that made him famous Until than if your a fan of King Solomon s Mines than read the book or watch the version with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone which is also not very good but its only and hour and forty minutes of your life gone instead of hours
1	The King of Masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship Set in s China during a time of floods we meet Wang an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him When a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends Wang he invites Wang to join their troupe However we learn that Wang s family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son Learning that Wang is childless Wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever Taking the advice to heart Wang purchases an year old to fulfill his legacy he would teach his new son Doggie the ancient art of silk masks Soon Wang discovers a fact about Doggie that threatens the rare and dying art Together Wang and Doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it The story is absorbing The setting is serene and the costuming simple Summarily it is an International Award winning art film which can t help but to move and inspire
1	Think Pierce Brosnan and you think suave dapper intelligent James Bond In this movie Brosnan plays against type and has lots of fun doing so as does the audience This is a film about a hired assassin who befriends a harried businessman and it works This is a fun movie with very good scenes a riveting on the edge Brosnan and a good compliant off the edge Kinnear have some good lines My only cavil is that Hope Davis playing the oh so tolerant wife Can I see your gun doesn t appear more often she could have been a marvellous foil to these men This movie is like a matador it plays with the audience while going for a kill The ending is awesome because a storyline with a positive moral emerges this is a frenetic frantic and fun movie which does deserve a wide audience
0	I watched this movie also and altho it is very well done I found it a heartbreaker and would not recommend this to women who have small children The terror on this mother s face when she sees her child about to be run over by a train is truly heartbreaking And the sad thing is internally she dies Eventually she goes back to the Applacian mountains All the money in the world which she makes from making dolls does not conceal the grief she has I remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of her clothes to try to have her child healed I m surprised this movie takes place in Detroit because when I watched it I thought for sure the people had come to Cincinnati Ohio This also was a route for the poor from the mountains
1	Every once in a while Eddie Murphy will surprise you In a movie like the Golden Child especially This is a movie you d figure would star maybe Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell or someone But Eddie really does work he s smart he s funny he s brave kind courteous thrifty clean and everything else a hero should be Having been chosen to secure a mystic child who holds the key to protecting the world from complete evil embodied perfectly by Dance Eddie goes from California to Nepal and back all while the beautiful Kee Nang Lewis wonders if he s all he says he is and a crazy old holy man Wong perfect as always knows that he is It s exciting breathtaking in spots shocking and of course funny Eddie is the only action hero I know who could begin a movie by making rude remarks behind some guy reading a porno magazine and end it with smart aleck remarks about Ed McMahon No problem with this Child it s a Golden find Nine stars Viva Nepal
0	What was the deal with the clothes They were all dressed like something out of the late s early s The cars were even were outdated The school was outdated The nuns attire was outdated and the hospital looked like something from the s with its wards and wooden staircases and things Nothing in the whole movie implied it took place in My mother was laughing saying Geeeee od WHEN was this movie MADE When we pressed the INFO BUTTON on our remote we were sure had to be typo Did anybody else notice this My FAVORITE part though was when the woman tells her uppity muck husband on the telephone about the inverted cross in the mirror and he just says Well look I ve got a congress meeting I ll talk to you about it later That line was just classic JUST LIKE A MAN My mothers favorite part was when they gave the Spawn of the Devil Child her very own Rottweiler My mother said Just what the Spawn of the Devil needs a Rottweiler She also enjoyed all of the people collapsing in the churches clutching their chests Her OTHER favorite part was the guy at the school parking lot driving miles a hour driving right into the garbage truck dump truck front end loader thingee He had about seconds to just stop the car but he just kept going with a real dumb vacant look on his face I mean how fast can you GO in a school parking lot Whatever
0	It is hard to describe this film and one wants to tried hard not to dismiss it too quickly because you have a feeling that this might just be the perfect film for some years old girl This film has a nice concept the modern version of Sleeping Beauty with a twist It has some rather dreamy shots and some nice sketches of the young boy relationship with his single working mother and his schoolmate a nice start you might say but then it got a bit greedy very greedy it tries to be a science fiction a drama a thriller a possible romantic love story fairy tale a comedy and everything under the sun The result just left the audience feeling rather inadequate For example the scene when the girl played by Risa Goto finally woken by his Yuki Kohara kiss instead of being romantic it try s to be scary in order to make us laugh afterwards it is a cheap trick because it ruin all the anticipation and emotion which it was trying to build for the better half of the film I have not read the original story the film is base on it is the well known work by the comic book artist Osamu Tezuka is famous with his intriguing and intricate stories I wonder if all the problems exsist in the original story or did it occur in the adaption It is rather illogical even for someone who is used to the fussy logic of those japanese comic book For instance how did Yuki Kohara s character manage to get to the hospital in an instant when its suppose to be a long bus ride away to run away Risa Goto s character in front of the tv cameras right after he saw her live interview on the television There are also some scenes that is directly copied very uncreative from other films and they all seem rather pointlessly annoying ie the famous the Lion mouth has caugh my hand scene from the Roman Holiday The film tries to be everything but ends up being nothing it fails to be a fairy tale and it did not have enough jokes to be a comedy and strangely there are some scenes that even seem like an unintentional ghost movie Nevertheless one should give it credit that it has managed to caputured some of the sentiment of the japanese teenager It is by watching this film I have a feeling that there might be some films that should have come with a warning label that said this film might only be suitable for person under the of age it would have definitly been on the poster of this film
1	This an free adaptation of the novels of Clarence Mulford fans of the Willaim Boyd films will probably feel a little at sea here and the reviews here so far reflect that But I knew of Hopalong from the novels first and never cared much for the Boyd films once I got around to them Christopher Coppola has made a wise choice he has not made a nostalgic Western instead he has approached the Cassidy story as a slice of what we used to call Americana or what older critics once called homespun As the film unraveled I found myself more and more reminded of the great Hallmark Theater version of Mark Twain s Roughing It with James Garner narrating Both these films remind us that although films about the old west are probably always to be mythic for Americans they need not be westerns they can very well be just films about what it meant to be American in that time in that place I never feel pandered to watching this film there s no effort to shove the Boyd Cassidy legacy down our throats no irony no camp Consequently I get a sense of these characters as having walked or ridden horseback across some real western America I too could have walked a hundred years ago Given that the plainness of the film it positively avoids anything we have come to call style is all to its favor and the plain acting of the performers fits neatly in with this gosh it really does feel like some story told around a campfire on a cattle drive no visual dressing just the quirks and good humor and sudden violence that we expect from the good narration of an adventure yarn I was very pleasantly surprised by this film and if the viewer sets aside encultured expectations he or she will find considerable pleasure in it I would have given this film stars but I ll give it a ten just because most reviewers here have missed the point completely and I urge them to set their memories of Boyd aside and give this film another chance Note A reviewer complained that Hopalong shoots people dead in this film rather than shooting the guns out of their hands ala Boyd s Cassidy first Cassidy DOES shoot people dead in the novels second if Cassidy were a real cowboy he would have shot people dead the problem with shooting guns out of people s hands is that they can always get another gun which happens to be part of the subtext of this very film Note I admit that I am jealous of the Coppola family that they have the Director of The Godfather among them who can get them all opportunities to make movies that I can t but a good movie is a good movie and this is a good movie If it s by somebody by the name Coppola well that s just is as it is America is the land of opportunity or was until Bush got into office that s what the great American novels are all about
0	I gave this a four purely out of its historical context It was considered lost for many years until it popped up out of the blue on Showtime in the early nineties Moe is the straight man and Larry and Curly act as a duo Spade Cooley has a couple of numbers I guess it had something to do with working on a ranch I m not quite sure because the plot was so minimal nothing really sticks in my memory I vaguely remember it being a western musical comedy Even the Stooge s seem to be going through the motions Overall there s nothing much really to recommend here If you re not a Stooge fan then don t bother If you are a Stooge fan then stick with the shorts
0	For me this movie just seemed to fall on its face The main problem for me was the casting of Glover as a serial killer I don t know whether this grows out of type casting or simply his demeanor but I doubt Glover could ever portray a convincing villain He s a good guy and that s always obvious in his performances Other than that the film is your run of the mill serial killer story Nothing very innovative
0	Awful simply awful It proves my theory about star power This is supposed to be great TV because the guy who directed battlestar Titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick B O R I N G Find something a thousand times more interesting to do like watch your TV with no picture and no sound I rated it so high b c there aren t any negative scores in the IMDb com rating system ZaphoidPS My theory about star power is the more star power used in a show the weaker the show is It s called an indirect proportionality quality star power less sp makes for better quality etc Another way to look at it is more is less Z
0	A wealthy Harvard dude falls for a poor Radcliffe chick much to the consternation of his strict father Ray Milland Syrupy sugary and most of all sappy story about a battle of the classes when rich kid Ryan O Neal brings home a waif of a librarian for his snobbish parents to ridicule Ali MacGraw is the social derelict with the filthy mouth while John Marley plays her devout Catholic father but no one in the film is more annoying than O Neal himself with his whimpering portrayal as Harvard s champion yuppie Followed years later by Oliver s Story
1	Still Crazy is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of all time It has been erroneously compared to This Is Spinal Tap which it has no relation to Spinal Tap is a satire and quite frankly not a very good one in spite of it s outing of many rock clich s Unlike Tap Still Crazy is populated by great actors great songs and great human situations You CARE about the people in Still Crazy That s all that matters Oh yeah the music s pretty damn good too written by Mick Jones of Foreigner and Chris Difford of Squeeze American audiences were already familiar with Stephen Rea The Crying Game but would only later become familiar with Bill Nighy Underworld Love Actually Pirates Of The Caribbean II and Timothy Spall the Harry Potter movies
0	Carlo Verdone once managed to combine superb comedy with smart and subtle social analysis and criticism Then something happened and he turned into just another dull holier than thou director Il Mio Miglior Nemico can more or less be summarized in one line working class kind and warm while upper class snob and devious But love wins in the end Such a trite clich for such a smart director There isn t really too much to talk about in the movie Every character is a walking stereotype the self made man who forgets his roots but who ll become good again the scorned wife the rebellious rich girl who falls for the honest but poor guy Acting is barely average Severely disappointing under every aspect
1	Ok so it may not be the award winning movie of the year type film apart from the brilliant soundtrack that I think won a few awards but it is a really great film about The Kid Prince O take your pick and the happenings around him living in Minneapolis playing his music The music is absolutely superb in my opinion you HAVE to own this soundtrack it is truly a classic and sums up the eighties sounds and feel in a wonderful fashion And the movie itself plays out a nice plot it s worth seeing over and over again espeically if you like Prince O which I do of course
1	I have seen The Running Man several times as I am a Stephen King fan and have all his movies but now it is even better because up until days ago I didn t know about this website and I didn t realize that the Paul Michael Glaser that was involved with this movie was the same Paul Michael Glaser that I grow up watching on Starsky and Hutch television show For me this is a pleasant surprise because I can t tell you how many times I cried when Starsky or Hutch got hurt The episode where Starsky Kill Starsky almost died I cried so hard My dad had to turn away from the show What to you expect of a kid at age Now I intentionally look for films and programs involving Paul or David Soul and anything that Stephen King has his hands on I m so there Just got to say Happy birthday Paul
1	This is a rip roaring British comedy movie and one that i could watch over and over again without growing tired Peter Ustinov has never performed in a bad role and this is no exception particularly with his dry wit but very clever master plan Karl Malden has always been an admirer of mine since he starred in Streets of San Francisco I believe that Maggie Smith is the real star of this film though appearing to be so inept at everything she tries to do but in truth is so switched on particularly at the end when she informs everyone that she has invested so much money that she has discovered whilst laundering his clothes One thing does concern me though could someone please tell me why i cannot purchase this on either DVD or VHS format in the UK could someone please assist
0	May the saints preserve us because this movie is not going to help Someone with access needs to e mail Mel Gibson and tell him we need a faithful production of Beowulf Something that actually has something in common with the epic poem that is the foundation for all modern western literature The recent since versions of Beowulf make we wonder two things First why is there so much interest in the story Second why are all these filmmakers squandering mountains of cash on this crap The only reason this got a two is that the version with Lambert in it Beowulf was worse and needed the What is even worse some people will watch this and get the wrong idea about the poem How can an industry where Peter Jackson gets a literary conversion to film so right can get it so wrong I mean really the Roman Forum as a model for Heorot is too much And PLEASE horns on helmets Spare me This is insulting hjm
0	This was one of the worst movies i have ever seen The plot is awful and the acting is worse The jokes that are attempted absolutley suck Don t bother to waste your time on a dumb movie such as this And if for some reason that you do want to see this movie don t watch it with your parents
0	Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series Despite the tragic nature of a middle aged man seemingly unable to pursue his dreams because of his overbearing manipulative father it was incredibly light hearted and fun to watch in practice In my opinion it is without doubt one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time The TV series has my out of rating without reservation This movie spin off on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word Hardly any of the essence of the TV show is transferred successfully onto film This movie has a very dreary depressing tone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions Seeing Harold being beaten up in a pub and not in a comical way is not my idea of comedy but is most definitely one reason why fans of the TV series will not like this movie The movie was painfully unfunny except for the scene where Albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbour The romance between Harold and Zita is completely out of tone and it makes me wonder whether the producers of this movie ever bothered to watch the TV series In the TV series Harold always went after respectable girls not strippers Albert s reactions to the remarks made against him by Harold s girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the TV series In the movie Albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity rises Most movie spin offs of British sitcoms tend to be quite dull with the notable exception of the ON THE BUSES films which in some respects were actually better than the TV series itself But STEPTOE AND SON has to rank right at the very bottom of the pile even below GEORGE AND MILDRED My advice skip this one and see the second spin off STEPTOE AND SON RIDE AGAIN instead It has a much lighter tone is more faithful to the TV series and is actually very funny
1	Perhaps the funniest backstage at Hollywood movie ever especially for a look at comedy short factories like Keystone Marion Davies should get a medal for bravery for taking a part where acting poorly in front of a camera is part of the role Plenty of cameos for film buffs
1	The saddest thing about this film is that only people cared to leave a review of it and NO ONE felt it worthwhile leaving a comment on the message boards Made the same year as Philadelphia the Tom Hanks Oscar winner this is the film that people REALLY should have seen and given awards to There is more humanity life love tenderness and beauty in these two people than in just about any other gay film I have seen and it is all true In order for this to be printed I need to leave a few more lines of text suffice it to say that anyone who REALLY wants to know what it was like to be gay in the s and s and to understand just what AIDS was like before the modern drug cocktails allowed people to breathe a little easier this is the film to see Oh and I will add a personal comment about AIDS Despite everything there actually has been a silver lining to all the horror When AIDS first arrived it was called the gay cancer and governments preferred to let them die rather than spend a red cent on research to help save a bunch of fags Then it became clear that AIDS would also be a heterosexual disease But the government wasn t ready for that So when straight people began getting ill too the only organizations and associations that were available to them were those which had been set up by gays themselves examples The Names Project the quilt memorializing all those who died of AIDS Act Up etc The result is that people who probably would never have come in contact with gays in their ordinary lives suddenly found themselves counting on them and needing them because no other organizations existed This close contact in my estimation is what finally broke down the barriers of prejudice and allowed the straight world to finally accept gays as equals When AIDS first came on the scene many of us thought that the straight world would use it as a way to come down even harder on us and that probably would have been true if straights didn t suddenly become ill too nevertheless the strides that have been made in gay liberation to the point that as I write this there are at least countries in the world that accept gay marriage these gains would probably have taken a lot longer without AIDS to bring us together It is sad to think that all those people both straight and gay had to die before our common humanity became more obvious but if what I am writing here is true and I think it is then there is a bit of comfort to be taken in realizing that all those people did not die in vain
0	A reasonable effort is summary for this film A good sixties film but lacking any sense of achievement Maggie Smith gave a decent performance which was believable enough but not as good as she could have given other actors were just dreadful A terrible portrayal It wasn t very funny and so it didn t really achieve its genres as it wasn t particularly funny and it wasn t dramatic The only genre achieved to a satisfactory level was romance Target Audiences were not hit and the movie sent out confusing messages A very basic plot and a very basic storyline were not pulled off or performed at all well and people were left confused as to why the film wasn t as good and who the target audiences were etc However Maggie was quite good and the storyline was alright with moments of capability
1	I usually steer clear of TV movies because of the many ways you know that it s TV movies five seconds into the picture This one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy well crafted mood that is established from the very start While the ever present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story even if claiming to be set in California the movie was largely shot around a stormy Vancouver B C the dark and oppressive outdoors beautifully complement Olmos excellent acting
0	How this film gains a rating is beyond belief It deserves nothing better than a and clearly should rank among IMDb s worst films of all time National Treasure is an affront to the national intelligence and just yet another assault made on American audiences by Hollywood Critics told of plot holes you could drive a wheeler through I love the justifications for this movie being good Nicholas Cage is cute Come on people no wonder people around the world think Americans are stupid This has to be the most stupid insulting movie I have ever seen If you wanted to see an actually decent film this season consider Kinsey The Woodsman Million Dollar Baby or Sideways National Treasure unfortunately got a lot more publicity than those terrific films I bet most of you reading this haven t even heard of them since some haven t been widely released yet Nicholas Cage is a terrific actor when he is in the right movies Time after time I ve seen Cage waste his terrific talent in awful mind numbing films like Con Air The Rock and Face Off When his talent is put to good use like in Charlie Kaufman s Adaptation he is an incredible actor Bottom line I d rather feed my hand to a wood chipper than be subjected to this visual atrocity again
1	This is not so bad that it is good it is purely good For those who don t understand why you have the intellect of a four year old in response to a certain comment Anyways Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of itself a parody of you and a parody of me It is the single most genius text in cinematic history I have it and the three prequels sitting on my DVD rack next to Herzog and Kurosawa It embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard I write scripts and this movie single handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me the likes of which we have never seen It can only be taken in portions its sort of exploitive by now I m just trying to take up the ten line minimum My comment ended a while ago Hopefully it works when I submit it now
1	A kid with ideals who tries to change things around him A boy who is forced to become a man because of the system A system who hides the truth and who is violating the rights of existence A boy who inspired by Martin Luther King stands up and tells the truth A family who is falling apart and fighting against it A movie you can t hide from You see things and you hear things and you feel things that you till the day you die will hope have never happened for real Violence frustration abuse of power parents who can t do anything and a boy with I am sorry balls a boy who will not accept things who will not let anything happen to him a kid with power and a kid who acts like a pro like he has never done anything else he caries this movie to the end and anyone who wants to see how abuse found place back in the ies
1	Things to Come is that rarity of rarities a film about ideas Many films present a vision of the future but few attempt to show us how that future came about The first part of the film when war comes to Everytown is short but powerful Ironically film audiences in its release year laughed at reports that enemy planes were attacking England appeasement was at its height Wells prediction was borne out all too soon The montage of endless war that follows while marred by sub par model work is most effective The explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of German Expressionist graphic design The art director was the great William Cameron Menzies and his sets of the ruins of Everytown are among his best work Margaretta Scott is very seductive as the Chief s mistress The Everytown of the st century is an equally striking design The acting in the st century story is not compelling perhaps this was a misfired attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this time with the barbarism of Unfortunately the model work representing angry crowds rushing down elevated walkways is laughably bad and could have been done much better even with s technology This is particularly galling since the scenes of the giant aircraft are very convincing This is redeemed by Raymond Massey s magnificent speech that concludes the film rarely has the ideal of scientific progress been expressed so well Massey s final question is more relevant now than ever in an era of severely curtailed manned spaceflight The scene is aided by the stirring music of Sir Arthur Bliss whose last name I proudly share Unfortunately the VHS versions of this film are absolutely horrible with serious technical problems Most versions have edited out a rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that takes us from to I hope a good DVD exists of the entire film
0	The funny sound that you may hear when you eyeball this execrable version of Jules Verne s classic Journey to the Center of the Earth is Verne spinning in his grave The only thing about this minute opus that has anything to do with Journey to the Center of the Earth is the title Otherwise everything else in this lackluster production is new and not worth watching In fact the director has written here at IMDb COM that he directed only eight minutes of Journey to the Center of the Earth and the studio tacked on part of Dollman helmer Albert Pyun s sequel to his own Alien from L A with Kathy Ireland Evidently the producers ran out of money and to satisfy overseas contractual obligations they grafted Pyun s sequel onto director Rusty Lemorande s movie Please don t rent or buy this wretched piece of garbage Unlike director Henry Levin s period piece Journey to the Center of the Earth with James Mason and Pat Boone Lemorande s Journey to the Center of the Earth takes place in contemporary times in Hawaii Two fellows a British nanny and a dog are brought together for the adventure of a lifetime purely by coincidence Richard Paul Carafotes of Blind Date and his comic book obsessed brother Bryan Ilan Mitchell Smith of Weird Science are going out to explore a cave The heroine Crystina Nicola Cowper of Underworld works for a domestic service called Nannies R Us Being a nanny has been Crystina s life long dream but she has made a less of all five of her nanny jobs Nevertheless her sympathetic supervisor Ms Ferry Lynda Marshall of Africa Express sends her to Hawaii Crystina s new client rock star Billy Foul Jeremy Crutchley of Doomsday who is scheduling one last concert to revive his flagging career has a dog named Bernard Foul wants Crystina to take Bernard to a doggie day spa Crystina is waiting on the arrival of her taxi when a careless motel attendant accidentally puts the basket that conceals Bernard in Richard s jeep You see Foul has hidden his canine in a basket because motel management strictly prohibits pets on their premises Foul has disguised the dog as a human baby Anyway Crystina catches a cab and tells the driver follow Richard After she catches up with them to get her dog the cabbie cruises away and abandons her Crystina demands that Richard drive her back to town but he has other plans Unhappily Crystina joins the guys and they get lost and then find themselves in the lost city of Atlantis a police state ruled by a dictator at the center of the Earth The rulers of Atlantis repeatedly notify their citizens that life on the surface does not exist Our heroes and heroine stumble onto Atlantis quite by accident Atlantis resembles a disco and everybody looks like they are straight out of a punk rock opera The ruler of Atlantis General Rykov Janet Du Plessis of Operation Hit Squad is orchestrating a raid on the surface with clones of the first human Wanda Saknussemm Kathy Ireland of Necessary Roughness to visit Atlantis Predictably General Rykov machinations to rule Atlantis and overthrow the Earth fails and our heroes and heroine save the day Journey to the Center of the Earth is an abomination The movie seems to be a comedy despite its superficial satire about dictatorships Albert Pyun is one of my favorite low budget action directors but he blew it on this lightweight shambles of a science fiction saga
1	Lapyuta Castle in the Sky more than any of Hayao Miyazaki s movies brings the joy of storytelling to the audience It is the kind of movie that makes one feel like a kid again it s just magical It s a crime that it took this long for it to be released in the states but now that it s here check it out And stick with the original language the dub changed my impressions of the characters somewhat which is something that should be avoided at all costs in a translation of a movie or book whatever I give it a ten ten
0	In my humble opinion this version of the great BDWY musical has only two things going for it Tyne Daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script OK Vanessa Williams is good to watch But to me that s all there is Most of the cast seem to be walking through the show Chynna Phillips has no idea who Kim really is and no wonder people walk over Harry McAfee when it s played by George Wendt who looks like he d rather be back on a bar stool in Boston Jason Alexander is passable but that wig has to go and I saw better dancing in Bugsy Malone As I mentioned it s good to have a version of the stage script now but I hope the young out there who have never seen a musical DON T judge them all by this
1	Although Super Mario isn t like the rest of the games in the series it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games Games with this much replay value are few and far between Plus this game has so much variety There are levels each with several different tasks you can do and many other hidden tasks The game isn t very challenging but its lack of challenge doesn t take away from the game at all Once you beat it you ll want to erase your game and start again And its just as much fun the second time or third time or two hundredth time A must own for any Nintendo owner and is a reason in itself to own a Nintendo
0	Someone should tell Goldie Hawn that her career as a teen age gamin ended thirty years ago This is one of the worst films released in years an unequivocal disaster in which the two leads give themselves over to a frenetic exposition of their trademark tics in an effort to make up for a bad script and bad directing This thing should have been smothered at birth I hope John Cleese got paid a lot for having his name attached to this disaster He is the only performer who came through this stinking mess more or less unscathed his only fault being a failure to realize that the rest of the cast would sink the picture
0	Bamboo House of Dolls or various years are given for this title is a Hong Kong veteran Chin Hung Kuei s Killer Snakes Boxer s Omen Payment in Blood etc women in prison flick produced by the legendary Shaw Brothers Yes even they got their hands into low exploitation sickies like this and Bamboo is definitely among the worse attempts of the whole genre even when compared to the Western attempts that usually pale in comparison with the Eastern films The story is about a Japanese war camp in which the Chinese women are brutalized abused and raped by the bad Japanese what else during the World War II The girls also know a secret place in which a box full of gold is hidden and also learn that a Chinese military officer raised in Japan Shaw veteran Lo Lieh is actually now an undercover agent among the other Japanese and naturally helps the girls escape the hell What follows is sequences full of gratuitous nudity female kung fu some nasty torture gore sleaze and extremely offensive anti Japan attitude that make this film pure and honest garbage that doesn t even try to be more than it is There are hardly any interesting elements in Bamboo House of Dolls The occasional photography especially at the end looks nice with its sunbeams and beautiful nature but that s about it in the merits department The fight scenes are plenty and always include half naked females hitting and kicking each other The violence overall is quite nasty at times with several bullet wounds misogynistic torture scenes for example one poor girl is brutalized on the floor filled with broken glass etc and extremely repulsive ending and moral behind it Of course it is stupid to talk about moral when writing about this kind of film but still there are elements I won t accept to be found from any film The film has also some enjoyable turkey elements for sure For example the gold box filled with heavy gold seems suspiciouly light as the weak and suffered girls don t seem to have any problems lifting and moving it not to speak of throwing it Also those numerous skin fight scenes make this quite smile inducing for fans of trash cinema I have seen the same director s Killer Snakes which is ten times more noteworthy as a piece and even though it has many alive snakes killed for real it is also visually more interesting and shows us some nasty sides of the other side of the big city and society Also it is a must for those who fear snakes Bamboo House of Dolls has suffered some censorship too which isn t a surprise considered the subject matter The uncut version dubbed into a non English language released in Europe at least in France Italy and Switzerland runs PAL minutes while the cut English dubbed print released in Holland Belgium and Greece runs only minutes in PAL From what I ve heard the cut scenes are not only violence or other graphic stuff but also dialogue and plot development and the like Bamboo House of Dolls is garbage cinema in its most trashy form and definitely something I wouldn t have liked to see from the Shaw Brothers or Hong Kong in general Some of the Italian exploitation films of the same subject matter are much more interesting and noteworthy than this quite ridiculous calculated and worthless piece of cinema exploitation
0	This film is deeply disappointing Not only that Wenders only displays a very limited musical spectrum of Blues it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely boring The only highlight of the movie is the interview of a Swedish couple who were befriended with J B Lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories Wenders s introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly alluding to world s culture or actually American culture traveling in space but his limited looks on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the s renders this movie as a mere sleeping aid Yawn I had expected more of him
1	Purple Rain has never been a critic s darling but it is a cult classic and deserves to be If you are a Prince fan this is for you The main plot is Prince seeing his abusive parents in himself and him falling in love with a girl Believe it or not this movie isn t just singing and dancing There are many intense scenes and it is heartwarming Sometimes it comes off has funny but when it works it really works Very hit and miss No one can really act in the film Everyone is from one of Prince s side acts like The Time and Vanity Still it adds charm to the movie When ever Prince is on screen he lights it up and it fun to see him at his commercial peak In conclusion go and see this if you love Prince like me If you aren t a fan it ll make you one
1	This movie is a lot better than the asylums version mainly its war of the worlds The tripods look pretty cool but their walking and deaths could have been better The action scenes were really cool Walking walking walking walking oh my god stop walking please or i m going to kill myself The thunder child scene was my favorite sequence mainly because a ship rammed bunch of tripods Good movie I recommend it for people ho have read the book The music is awesome and the directors cut looks pretty cool pros Good soundtrack to the book Cool violence Tripods and handling machines are cool to look atcons some bad acting cheesy looking London
0	Hollywood s misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits For every Godfather II there are dozens of More American Graffiti s Stayin Alives and Grease s While the original Grease is not a great film the adaptation of the long running Broadway hit does have songs evocative of the s energetic choreography and an appealing cast When Paramount began work on a follow up the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbuster Fortunately for moviegoers Michelle Pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts Her talent and beauty were already evident herein and Pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform Maxwell Caulfield however lacks even the skill to express embarrassment and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic What romantic interest beyond hormones could the cool sassy Pfeiffer have in the deadpan Caulfield That dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory Only cameos by veterans such as Eve Arden Connie Stevens and Sid Caesar have any wit although Lorna Luft does rise slightly above the lame material Reviewers have complained that because Grease is always compared to the original the movie comes up lacking However even taken on its own terms the film is a clunker After a frenetic opening number which evidently exhausted the entire cast the energy dissipates With few exceptions the original songs bear little resemblance to the early s and the only nostalgia evoked is for Our Miss Brooks and Sid Caesar s Comedy Hour The jokes fall flat and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer Patricia Birch is clumsy to be polite However worse films have been inflicted on audiences and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters Unfortunately Grease is not even unintentionally funny Instead the film holds the viewer s attention like a bad train wreck Just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered the next scene plunges into even worse carnage
0	I had never heard of this one before it turned up on Cable TV It s very typical of late s sci fi sober depressing and not a little paranoid Despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple the film is pretty much put across in a documentary style which is perhaps a cheap way of leaving a lot of the exposition to narration and an excuse to insert as much stock footage as is humanly possibly for what is unmistakably an extremely low budget venture While not uninteresting in itself the apocalypse via renegade missile angle later utilized with far greater aplomb for both DR STRANGELOVE and FAIL SAFE and mercifully short the film s single minded approach to its subject matter results in a good deal of unintentional laughter particularly in the scenes involving an imminent childbirth and a gang of clueless juvenile delinquents
0	Three Stooges Have Rocket Will Travel This was the first feature length film to star the Stooges and it is pretty bad It makes THE THREE STOOGES GO AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAZE from look like a masterpiece The Stooges are janitors at a rocket place They climb into a rocket and it goes to Venus They meet some stuff there including a talking unicorn they call Uni which they bring back to Earth with them Uni speaks like an average pleasant person Oh hello How are you Lovely planet here Hope you like it Hilarious Very few gags and so many of the scenes just go on and on and on The Stooges arrive back from space and the film is over as far as the story goes but no one told that to the film makers for the picture continues for another minutes or so at a party where nothing much happens The Stooges leave the party and then the film is almost over High point of the film the end where the Stooges sing a dapper little song about their journey The Larry and Curly Joe hit Moe in the face with two pies Brutal Another writer mentioned the fine musical score Huh The only music I even noticed were two classic tunes I LL TAKE ROMANCE and THERE GOES THAT SONG AGAIN both of which are played at the party And that really is the high point of the picture music from old Columbia films The tall sexy blonde was nice Awful a brand new VHS video from the Cents Only store
1	Using Buster Keaton in the twilight of his career was an interesting choice He may have been the most talented comedian of the silent age This gives him a chance to display those talents in a little time travel story He get hooked up with a guy living in modern times and it becomes obvious that we are best left in our own times Keaton is able to do his sight gags very well I ve heard his voice before I believe he did some of those Beach Party films playing some vacuous characters just to earn a few bucks Serling seemed to have respect for him and portrayed him that way It s not a bad story It shows how one reacts when we wish for something we don t have and get that wish
1	Some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough Well if you regard it as an action movie this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting However I think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one The movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences Tomas Beccket who was a veteran and had confirmed kills looked as if he was cold hearted However after Beccket showed his day dream of Montana we can clearly see his softness inside It was the cruel war and his partners sacrifice that made Beccket become so called cold hearted Millar on the contrary was a new comer a green hand and was even not qualified as a sniper Billy Zane did quite well to show millar s hesitation and fear when he first tried to put a bullet through one s heart as what Beccket said What he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award These two guys were quite different in their personalities and I think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities These two snipers quarreled suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other Sniper isn t a good action movie but a good psychological one
0	Of all movies and I m a film graduate if that s worth anything to you this is THE WORST movie I have ever seen I know there are probably some worse ones out there that I just haven t seen yet but I have seen this and this is the worst A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover Talk about being young and retarded She s uncredited Her role was unbelievably small How did she make it on the cover IMDb doesn t even list it in her filmography This movie was so bad we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it and slipped it inside the case It read something like please save your further customers from having to view this complete and totally bad movie
0	No wonder this movie never saw the light of day The timing was of the release was awful The Gong Show had already jumped the shark by the time the movie came out so who would pay money just to see a few of the censored clips from the original run of the show And the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic minute whine by Chuck Barris about how hard his life was as host of the show Did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his messed up millionaire life Did he really think we even wanted to KNOW about his life Obviously so since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a CIA operative Did he think the gag of having everyone everywhere audition for him would stay fresh for minutes Or the network executive hounding him at every turn This might have worked as the plot for a minute sitcom episode but not as a full length movie However it was nice to see Rip Taylor Gene Gene and the Unknown Comic again although to make the movie spicy they included only his most vulgar routines And as someone else has pointed out this is Phil Hartman s first significant movie part even though it lasts only a minute Note his name is spelled HARTMANN in the credits which is the name he was born with You can t miss his voice and facial expressions even though he s much thinner and younger than in the SNL days Ed Molinaro Hill Street Blues also has a tiny part one of his first after leaving the soap world
1	And the time came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom Anais Nin Marcel Proust says The real voyage of discovery lies in not seeing new landscapes but in having new eyes Author and screenwriter Antwone Fisher joined the U S Navy to see new landscapes but the demons of his past prevented him from seeing the world through new eyes Based on his autobiography Finding Fish written many years after the events his story is dramatized in the film Antwone Fisher Denzel Washington s first directorial effort It is a heartfelt if somewhat formulaic look at the painful process of moving from being consumed by one s past to being able to live life in present time Required to attend therapy sessions after several outbursts of anger at the base the painful aspects of his childhood are shown in flashback as the grown up Antwone Derek Luke recounts his life in sessions with Navy Psychiatrist Jerome Davenport Denzel Washington He is at first unwilling to talk but when he begins the floodgates are opened After his father was shot to death by a girlfriend and Antwone was abandoned by his mother after being released from prison he was placed in a foster home where he lived for fourteen years suffering humiliation and sexual abuse According to Antwone the treatment by his foster mother Mrs Tate Novella Nelson who referred to him only as nigga and by his cousin Nadine Yolonda Ross was in fact much worse than shown on the screen The only friend he has is a local by named Jesse Jascha Washington who later in the film only adds to his feelings of abandonment It is difficult to build a film around psychiatric sessions but it was done successfully in Ordinary People and Good Will Hunting with a great deal more dramatic interest but it succeeds here because of the dominant performances of Washington and Luke though the film s attempt to compress eleven years into a few months seems a bit too facile Davenport s humanity and warmth however allows Fisher to feel safe enough to discuss his difficult past and Cheryl Joy Bryant his new girlfriend who is also in the Navy supports him in his struggle to achieve a breakthrough With Cheryl s help and Dr Davenport s counseling Antwone develops enough self esteem to return to Cleveland and begin the journey to try and find his mother in order to complete the past What comes through in Derek Luke s incredible performance is Antwone s longing for acceptance dramatized in a heartbreaking dream shown at the beginning of the film in which he is the guest of honor at a banquet filled with people who love him Comedian Mort Sahl once said that people just have to remember what we re all here for to find our way home Antwone Fisher touches not only on the longing of one young person to find his way home but reaches all those who have cried themselves to sleep not knowing the joy of being loved
0	That s right you heard me this movie is a freaking ABOMINATION First off the band who the hell is going to go see or listen to a band called THE NAKED BROTHERS BAND Not only is the name terrible but so are the musicians they can t even play anything Also the lead singer sounds more girly than Geddy Lee and even more his voice is horrible Not only are they terrible musicians but they re terrible actors Led by a crappy director and thin plot this has got to be the dumbest movie ever I wish this website would let you use a vote of ZERO OR BELOW out of because giving this filth a is being WAY too generous I m not sure that you can call this a comedy film If you re looking for comedy with music go to that Weird Al Yankovic guy cause he does it a whole lot better than these untalented tweens
1	This movies is the best movie to watch for comic book feel The sets costumes and the color are just so vivid it is just like stepping into a comic book This is the movie I think of when the Mob is mentioned the suits the hats and the attitudes Hoffman gives comic relief as Mumbles and you can t help but feel sorry for Madonna as she tries and fails to win Tracy over This movie contains all the classic mob clich s burying people in concrete blowing up peoples cars tieing up the good guy and attempting to blow up his girlfriends house This movie is a classic in ever sense of the word even camera angels cry out comic book Its so great to be able to go back to an older movie and see that someone knew how a comic should be made into a movie after seeing such mistakes as Spawn and the Hulk YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE
1	After having watched Guinea Pig two questions come in mind besides Am I really a psychopath to watch that Is it a snuff The answer is no although it s the closest thing to a snuff movie I ve ever seen And then Where the hell have they found that girl Because she gets tortured for min without any reasons given in fact there is nothing else in this movie Fingernails teared off beaten with hands feet tools infested by maggots and many more until the final scene I m still not sure how they did that Because it belongs to the japonese underground scene it s obvious she didn t get a lot of money So what were her their motivations I saw it in japonese without subtitles but it s not a problem no real dialogues the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes I haven t seen yet all the serial but the first Guinea Pig is not known for being the best one Still I ve rated because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff the issue is quite good ask Charlie Sheen the actor But I think they could have gone further which they did in the following ones Another movie I m hiding from my parents
1	Now this is one of Big s Best Jack Hulbert s single role in split into two for the Band Waggon radio team Askey Murdoch It boasts a great stalwart cast who ham the play up for all they re worth especially Askey of course Histrionics were provided by Linden Travers melodramatics by Herbert Lomas and pragmatics by Richard Murdoch The group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for ghostly trains spectral porters hairy sausage rolls and Arthur trying to entertain them all His repartee with everyone falls between side splitting and ghastly dull When the formula works it s very good but it sometimes gets very contrived and forced making the film seem more dated than it is But those damn treacherous fifth columnists thank any God Britain hasn t got any nowadays Ultimately a nice harmless film to welcome back to the TV screen as an old friend but if you were expecting to be shivered out of your timbers you ll probably be very disappointed

1	Anton Newcombe and Courtney Taylor are friends they both are the leads in their own respective bands Anton with The Brian Jonestown Massacre and Courtney with The Dandy Warhols What s interesting about their friendship is that they are rivals its a love hate relationship At times you both hear them praising one another but the next second they are complaining at how stupid and self absorbed they are While the Dandy Warhols went on the reach commercial success BJM still was stuck in the underground scene and for good reason why The focus of Dig is more towards Anton and the BJM as they have a lot more substance They are the most dysfunctional band During gigs they will fight and bash each other Anton will hit other members if he feels they aren t performing correctly With the amount of drugs an alcohol they consume fight was always waiting to happen You know how people go to car races just to see if a huge car crash happens that s why people would go to their gigs for the fights Anton is very unstable Always thinking himself as a music messiah he wants to change music and create a revolution but he could never get out of the underground He is a very talented musician its amazing how many instruments he can play and with such skill But his draw back is he cant escape the world he created a prolific musician stuck in a black hole drugs alcohol and depression On the other side the Dandy Warhols were having their own troubles They didn t find much success with their first album and were constantly fighting with their record label But they found huge success in Europe But Courtney keeps being sucked back into the world of Anton Its interesting that both Anton and Courtney both had what the other needed Courtney always wanted to be musically talented as Anton though Anton wouldn t say it he needed the commercial success that the Dandy s had to make his revolution Over the seven year course the film crew followed these two bands there is a lot of footage There is never a dull moment in Dig It is constantly moving along as it doesn t have time to slow down as it has to much to say seven years of story telling in the h mins is a hard job Ondi Timoner has done a great job of piecing together one of the best music documentaries that makes you always wanting more Even if you don t like the bands it still deserves viewing it transcends the music to reveal a great story of a successful failure You wont be disappointed
0	The Robin Cook novel Coma had already been turned into a pretty successful movie in A couple of years later it was the turn of another Robin Cook bestseller to get the big screen treatment but in the case of Sphinx virtually everything that could go wrong does go wrong This is a dreadful adventure flick consisting of wooden performances stupid dialogue unconvincing characters and leaden pacing The only reason it escapes a out of rating is that the Egyptian backdrop provides infinitely more fascination than the story itself Hard to believe Franklin J Schaffner of Patton and Planet Of The Apes is the director behind this debacle Pretty Egyptologist Erica Baron Lesley Anne Down is on a working vacation in Cairo when she stumbles across the shop of antiques dealer Abdu Hamdi John Gielgud Hamdi befriends Erica and is impressed by her enthusiasm and knowledge Consequently he shows her a beautiful and incredibly rare statue of Pharoah Seti I that he is keeping secretly in his shop The very existence of the statue arouses intense excitement in Erica for it could provide vital clues in locating Seti I s long lost tomb a prize as great as the discovery of Tutankhamun s tomb in Before Hamdi can tell Erica any more he is brutally murdered in his shop with Erica watching in silent terror as he meets his grisly end Afraid yet tantalised by what she has seen Erica attempts to track down the treasure She finds herself helped and hindered in her quest by various other parties none of whom are truly trustworthy For one there is Yvon Maurice Ronet seemingly a friend but perhaps a man with sinister ulterior motives Then there is Akmed Khazzan Frank Langella an Egyptian for whom Erica feels a certain attraction but who may also be hiding dangerous secrets from her The biggest problems with Sphinx generally result from its total disregard for plausibility Down couldn t be less convincing as a female Egyptologist one assumes she would be quite well educated and resourceful yet she spends the entire film screaming helplessly like some busty bimbo from a teen slasher flick On those rare occasions that she actually isn t running from a potential villain she does other brainless things such as taking Polaroid flash photos in a year old tomb The plot twists are heavy handed to say the least mainly comprising of revelations and double crosses that can be predicted well in advance One can t even try to enjoy the film on the level of dumb but entertaining action fare because the pacing is awfully sluggish What little action can be found is separated by long stretches of tedium A famous review of the movie declared Sphinx stinks Never before has a hour film been so aptly summed up in words
1	I think this movie got a low rating because it got judged by it s worst moments There is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut scratching scene but apart from that there are actually quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud Jason Lee is performing some wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie and Julia Stiles manages to be pretty damn funny herself Apart from that this movie behaves like most romantic comedies after about minutes into it you know how it is going to end Which is better than most of them where you already know after minutes Anyway better movies to watch but definitely not the worst pick Cheers
0	Outside of the fact that George Lopez is a pretentious jerk his show is terrible Nothing about Lopez has ever been funny I have watched his stand up and have never uttered any resemblance to a laugh His stuff comes across as vindictive and his animosity towards white people oozes out of every single pore of his body I have laughed at white people jokes from many a comedian and love many of them This guy has a grudge that won t end I feel bad for Hispanics who have only this show to represent themselves The shows plots are always cookie cutter with an Hispanic accent Canned laugh at the dumbest comments and scenes Might be why this show is always on at AM in replay
1	William Wyler was to have directed this adaptation of Moss Hart s hit Broadway play with music recruiting poster vivant but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman George Cukor The women s director has a sure touch on the many documentary like sequences of Air Corps training and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed particularly in wartime Sure the gee whiz and entirely white save for one unbilled Chinese American recruit bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life and the speechifying about home and Mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick but it s efficient propaganda and undeniably stirring Notable too for the all military male cast several of whom didn t reemerge for years Lon McAllister Edmond O Brien Martin Ritt Red Buttons in drag as an Andrews Sister Peter Lind Hayes Karl Malden Kevin McCarthy Gary Merrill Lee J Cobb and Don Taylor Also for a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday who doesn t show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some good little sequences as O Brien s worried sick Brooklyn spouse Too bad its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is mm evidently after Twentieth Century Fox released it to considerable success the rights reverted to the Army and if there s a good mm print out there it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon It s disingenuous and corny in spots but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vividly and it deserves to be more widely seen
0	The movie is pretty funny and involving for about four dates then it becomes a blatant commercial for some guy you and even his friends really can t stand It is a pretty interesting concept film dates on a quest to find true love in modern LA The problem is that it feels incredibly and badly scripted at times and blatantly self promoting It is difficult to care about and be drawn into any of the characters because the writer actor is so egotistical uncool untrue and simply unlikeable You end up feeling sorry for his dates
0	I don t think this is too bad of a show under the right conditions I tolerated the first season Unfortunately this is a show about lawyers who aren t really lawyers God forbid anybody actually go to law school based on these shows which I had heard was the case when I watched some interviews of the show It just made me gag a bit That aside Spader and Shatner who are supposed to be the stars of the show are the most annoying While this might be a compliment in some situations it s certainly not here Their constantly harassing the women on the show is funny at first But since that s what they re doing literally all the time I ve realized that this is as deep as the show is going to get Trying to intersperse some serious dramatic and even tear jerking moments in the middle of this mockery of a real show fails to compensate for the progressive loss of interest I ve been experiencing trying to enjoy the show Alan Shore s flamboyant and gratuitous public service announcements where he spouts off his opinions do not impress Denny Crane is just annoying I was embarrassed for him and for the writers of the show for Crane s speech wearing a colonial outfit I m giving two stars because there are moments where I thought the show s attempts to deal with some contemporary issues were done with care I think the show s writers became aware that the sexual harassment displayed by Denny and Alan was getting overbearing even to those who were more inviting of them from the start The thing is I don t care if the sexual harassment treatment in the show is done well but I just felt that the writer was insulting me with artificially implanting sexual banters all over the show in the hopes that my libido will keep me coming back for more I m not a teenager anymore and I think this show is promising if its goal wasn t to cater to the lowest common denominator to get ratings Of course I m writing this after I realized that it s really not gonna get much better than this It s a shame because it s one of those shows I d love to love
1	I was reviewing some old VHS tapes I have and came across The TV show John Denver The Muppets A Christmas Together This made me go to my computer and look it up to see if I could find a DVD version of this show to buy I was disappointed not to be able to find it yet on DVD The show aired in and was a delightful show I have the record and the CD but I would love to buy a DVD version of this show The tape is old and picture quality is pretty good but fading the sound is not as good as the CD There is also a few other songs not put on the CD As a Fan of John Denver and of the Muppets a DVD of this show would really be a good seller If you don t have the CD it is a wonderful Chritmas collection of songs taken from that show The album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play it on
1	Ettore Scola one of the most refined and grand directors we worldly citizens have is not yet available on DVD it s summer right now Mysteries to goggle the mind This grand classic returned to the theaters in my home town thanks to a Sophia Loren summer retrospective and to see it again on the big screen after all these years of viewing it on a video tape it is a true gift To avoid a critique but nonetheless try to prove a point i took my reluctant younger brother with me to see this film He never saw the film before and doesn t like those Italian Oldies Like all the others in the theater he was intrigued by this wonder Even during the end titles the theater remained completely silent This SPECIAL DAY is truly special A wonder of refinement And a big loss if you haven t seen it yet
0	Darkness was entertaining to some degree but it never seemed to have a plot lacking one more so than other films that have been accused of this detriment i e Bad Taste It started off really good with a man running from something It was very creepy for these first few minutes but after a time the film just became entertaining on the level of gore which was hard to make out at some points due to poor lighting and horrible recording quality anyway The film was hard to believe because of the juvenile acting which most of the time seemed like some friends talking to a video camera making lines up as they went That with a lack of any plot whatsoever made it look like the film was started without and ended without a script of any kind As said before gore was this film s only drawing point which much of the time was hard to make out
1	I loved this movie First because it is a family movie Second because it offers a refreshing take on dealing with the news of HIV in a family with far less hysteria than what I have normally seen in the movies The brothers are very close yet are not judgmental Their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble but not needed in the end I understand that Leo s choice on how to deal with his treatment may not have been the most popular one with people but I believed it was the right choice for him I can t believe that this was a french television programme It had great production values I gave this movie a ten and I think you will too once you have seen it
0	I am working my way through the Chilling Classics Movie Pack Collection and THE WITCHES MOUNTAIN El Monte de las brujas is something like the th movie in the set The movie had nothing to it to hold my attention at all The plot was incoherent The dialog seemed improvised The acting was poor The characters were unsympathetic The best scene is the beginning with an exasperated woman that is driven to burning her seemingly bratty daughter However the only connection this scene has to the rest of the movie is the lead character Mario who has the most stupendous mustache ever But that s it The film was not effective on any level The music was too intrusive The lighting was very dark so that some scenes are almost completely black It really is barely watchable what more can I say
0	As I watch this film it is interesting to see how much it marginalizes Black men The film spends its time showing how powerless the most visible Black man in it is save for an heroic moment For much of the film the other Black men and dark skinned Black women in the film are way in the background barely visible Vanessa Williams character was strong and sympathetic The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her There are also some fairly visible and three dimensional support characters who are light skinned and some White characters of some warmth and dignity But of the Black males in this film are nothing but invisible men Voiceless shadows in the background of no consequence Such a horrible flaw but anything but unusual in the mainstream media
1	I totally got drawn into this and couldn t wait for each episode The acting brought to life how emotional a missing person in the family must be together with the effects it would have on those closest The only problem we as a family had was how quickly it was all explained at the end We couldn t hear clearly what was said and have no idea what Gary s part in the whole thing was Why did Kyle phone him and why did he go along with it Having invested in a series for five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes was kept back for the conclusion I have asked around and none of my friends who watched it were any the wiser either Very strange but maybe we missed something crucial
0	I was forced to watch this whole series of films as a young child and I was told they were REAL Talk about child abuse I would have been less frightened of Dracula or Frankenstein This series is only good for people who believe in this ridiculousness and who want to indoctrinate their children into believing the same Besides the obvious issues associated with brainwashing and indoctrination there s also the bad acting bad writing and BAD special effects They are just all around terrible terrible movies Yes believable and horrifying to a kid but I can t imagine a grown up buying into this shlock Although I must say that I would be interested in seeing them today as an adult They might have a certain midnight cult movie feel to them
0	As usual I am making a mad dash to see the movies I haven t watched yet in anticipation of the Oscars I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley I can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has There is no story A group of guys meander around Iraq One day they are here diffusing a bomb Tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire No wait here they are back in Bagdad There is no cohesive story at all The three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures By that I mean we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying We have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe And then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesn t follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little Iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers DVDs What do you think is going to happen Well do you think the cowboy soldier who doesn t follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways Why yes Do you think the Iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy Why yes There is no story here The script is juvenile and predictable The camera is shaken around a lot to make it look artsy And for all of you who think this is such a great war picture go rent Full Metal Jacket Deerhunter or Platoon Don t waste time or money on this boring movie
1	A DAMN GOOD MOVIE One that is seriously underrated The songs that the children sing in the movie gave me a sense of their pain but also their hope for the future Whoopi Goldberg puts in a good performance here but the best performance throughout the whole movie is that of the actress who plays the title character I wish she was in more movies This movie should have a higher rating I give it a
0	This story is about the romantic triangle between a nth African male prostitute a French transsexual prostitute Stephanie and a Russian waiter who speaks no French and never seems to shave As a film it is dull dreary and depressing shot either on foggy overcast winter days or in badly lit interiors where everyone is bathed in a weird blue luminescence And yes I know it s because the white balance was out Everyone is pale and downcast and looks haggard shabby and dirty Bodies are bony and shot in such closeup that they look quite ugly and unappealing Moles greasy hair Yuk Bad news in a film where people spend a lot of time either naked or having sex And the story Well Stephanie s mother is dying All three characters go back to Stephanie s home village where through a bunch of flashbacks to desolate countryside and predictably dingy interiors we see a bit of Stephanie s childhood as a boy called Pierre The mother dies Well and that s about it really Character development is kept to a minimum as is the denouement of the story I suppose the storyline is not linear it would explain a lot of non sequiteurs but really after paying my seven euros I don t feel like having to construct the film myself that s what the director takes my money for To expect me to join the story telling process and get my hands dirty so to speak is asking way too much This film is a heap of pretentious rubbish made above all from a desire to epater les bourgeois ie shock the straights I can see how it was a shoo in for the Berlin Film Festival and I can see why it got nowhere
0	A good idea badly implemented While that could summarize of the SciFi channel s movies it really applies here I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed and I like action movies and I like all of the main actors so this could have been great However despite some good acting this movie fails due to Bill Platt s bad writing and directing Another review made the good point of needing to know where you re going so you can get there This movie doesn t It s put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words second draft are not in Bill Platt s vocabulary There is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing This scene even begins and ends with them driving a car so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle This movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others some to the point where you can guess the entire plot up front It also had a habit of aborting a fight early probably just because they couldn t afford it There are also a few laughably bad scenes where the plot is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed toxic adhesive seriously what is that If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby watch this movie because she s OK She does manage to break out of her Roswell persona a few times and make for a good tough chick but not always John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he s ever done since playing Q back in ST TNG so that s nothing new In all I gave this movie a rating
0	I saw this movie once a long time ago and I have no desire to ever see it again This movie is about Preston Waters a hard lucked preteen who always seems to be overlooked by his family and who always seems to be short on cash All this changes when a bank robber runs over Preston s bike and passes him a blank check as compensation Preston uses the check to withdraw million from the bank ironically the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him the check Preston then buys a mansion and says that he s working as the assistant of a mysterious and wealthy backer named Mr Macintosh named after his computer After that he just goes crazy with the money On paper this sounds like a great idea However on screen it is one of the emptiest movies I ve ever seen For one thing it s too unbelievable I know some parts of the movie were meant to be incredible but I draw the line at a twelve year old boy going out with a thirty year old woman and being put in charge of a imaginary person s small fortune Also this was a shallow movie with weak acting a predictable plot line and characters who are less than memorable The characters were either cheesy over the top annoying or underdeveloped But Juice was a funny character If you re looking for a good movie to watch with your family skip this one
1	I watch romantic comedies with some hesitation for romantic comedies feature age old clich s which make a movie uninteresting Typically in a Romantic Comedy there is a girl and there is a guy both fall in love then have troubles and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever But this movie is a different story it is really very different from the Romantic Comedies I have seen of lately There is a widowed guy Dan there is a girl Marie Dan meets Marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime after sometime Marie has to leave Dan develops something for her and when this something starts to turn meaningful we get a twist Marie is the girlfriend of his brother Unheeded of the circumstances Dan flirts with Marie and realizes that he loves her and even Marie loves him but their love would not just be possible How it is made possible forms the rest of the story Steve Carell performs well Juliette Binoche is good as Marie And every other stuff is done well It is a good movie watch it
0	A group of forest rangers and scientists go into the woods to find fossils They stumble on a Bigfoot burial ground eventually the didn t notice it in the dark The scenes of the CGI Bigfoot are horrid but better than the endless scenes of talking that they rarely punctuate I used to think that there just might be a good Bigfoot movie to be made But now after so many sad sad movies about the legend I m having serious doubts To pour salt in the wound of watching this film the ONE good looking girl just doesn t get naked once And while this one MAY be better than Boggy Creek no mean feat there it s still sad that the best non documentary film on Bigfoot remains Harry and the Henriksons My Grade D
0	I borrowed this movie because not only because its gay theme but the thought of role playing really intrigued me I was pleasantly surprised that it was shot in San Francisco since I live near SF And of course it was nice to see shots of the Castro district although the castro to me really caters more to gay male than female But other than that I can t really recommend this movie The characters aren t really developed for me to care and when they finally started to get to the role playing I was already bored out of my mind And the role playing scenes that I did see were a bit embarrassing to watch The acting leaves something to be desired Needless to say I didn t finish the movie I d skip this one
1	This has to be one of the best comedies on the television at the moment It takes the sugary sweet idea of a show revolving around a close family and turns it into a quite realistic yet funny depiction of a typical family complete with sibling and parent spats brat brothers over protective fathers and bimbo sisters I m almost surprised it s Disney To its credit Simple Rules knows it s a comedy and doesn t try to be more Too many shows eg Sister Sister and Lizzie McGuire think just because its lead characters are now teenagers then they should tackle social issues and end up losing their humour by being too hard hitting This is a trap Simple Rules has avoided it does tackle some issues such as being the school outcast but it has fun while doing so In fact the only time it has really been serious was understandably when it sensitively handled the tragic death of John Ritter and his character And I think although John Ritter will be sadly missed since he was the reason the show made its mark Simple Rules can still do well if it remembers its humour and doesn t make Cate s father a second version of Paul Hennessy
0	For some reason in the late s and early s the local CBS affiliated station in New York kept playing this movie in it s late night slot on Friday or Saturday nights for several years usually at a m or some such time It s a fitting movie for that time slot since it s really hard to follow and quite odd see the other reviews for specific story info Anyway after catching it numerous times in those days just before cable TV And even after it hit but before they offered much all night programming I kept catching this little oddity After not seeing it for many years I decided to see if I could find it on DVD Well it is only available from every search i ve conducted anyway in a pretty lousy grainy print on the budget label Brentwood Video as part of a pack of movies movies on double sided discs called Alien Worlds if anyone is interested It s usually available for around but even much less if you shop around The other movies on this set are readily available in numerous other collections of public domain movies so no need to comment on them here But I haven t seen Eyes available anywhere else Though hardly a restored version in any way this print runs exactly minutes so for once IMDb s stated running time of minutes is not correct Even with the minute running time it s not unusual for a movie dubbed into English from another language to also have some of the running time trimmed It seems to be a common budget conscience practice to sometimes save money by not bothering to dub some scenes at all if they are not considered to be important to the story Would a longer version make in any less confusing Who really knows unless you ve seen it in it s native language By the way my attempts to watch this during the day don t work and I end up just turning it off There s something about watching this in the middle of the night that just fits this movie or maybe it s just from my earlier experiences who know
1	This film is scary because you can find yourself relating to ideas they have and can recall other people saying and having simialr ideas make this a haunting well done movie the camra style is not shakey to point it draws you out of film like blair witch it only adds to the raw real feeling of the film that makes it
1	For his first ever debut this film has some riveting and chilling moments In the best horror film fashion the pit of your stomach tightens every moment during this film The ending is superb The makers of Blaire Witch obviously watched this film it s ending wasn t an end but a beginning of the end A great movie and only a piece of Japan s great as far as scare factor a perfect score it makes you think and scared out of your mind
0	This is no doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen This makes your run of the mill TV movie look like Reservoir Dogs Based on a book by the one and only Britney Spears and her mother this is trash with nothing bar a reasonable performance from Virginia Madsen I hope you got paid well to save it The story of a red neck country gill who wins a scholarship in a prestigious music school is little but a vehicle to pedal Ms Spears pants music to the consumer and to generally agree that low brow must be the way There is nothing good going on here with all the beats as predictable as night following day Never ever again
0	What could have been an engaging and emotionally charged character study is totally undermined by the predictable factor Fox is OK as Nathaniel Ayers the Julliard trained musician who dreams of playing with the Walt Disney orchestra until his bouts with schizophrenia drive him into the street and ultimately skid row Looking for a good story to boost his flagging career reporter Steve Lopez Robert rehab Downey gets to know him and tells his story Taking every element of the classic how we hit the skids movies borrowing very liberally from A Beautiful Mind taking the bogus feel good attitude of films like Rocky you pick the sequel number and whipping up too much s style melodrama all that is left on the screen is a burnt out shell of a movie It is corny trite utterly predictable and plays way too often on our sentiments I hate to say it but this is the kind of movie that if you say you hated it people will give you bad looks I really wish I could say something positive about this film but I really can t The acting redeems it somewhat but not enough for me to give it more than one star Strictly made for TV movie stuff Not worth your time
0	This was one of the worst films I have ever seen I usually praise any film for some aspect of its production but the intensely irritating behaviour of more than half the characters made it hard for me to appreciate any part of this film Most common was the inference that the bloke who designed the building was at fault an avalanche collapsing it Er ok Also trying to out ski an avalanche slalom style is not gonna work Running feet into some trees is not gonna work Alas it does here As mentioned before the innate dumbness and sheer stupidity of some characters is ridiculous In an enclosed space with limited oxygen a four year old could tell you starting a fire is not a good idea Anyway about minutes of the movie redeems itself and acquires some appreciation However if you have a modicum of intelligence you too will find most of this film hard to tolerate It pains me that so many quality stories go unproduced and yet someone will pay for things like this to be made Oh did I mention the last five minutes Well to give you a hook you have to keep watching in order to see the latest in combative avalanche techniques Absolutely priceless
0	First of all yes I m white so I try to tread lightly in the ever delicate subject of race anyway White People Hating Black people BAD but Black People Hating White people OK because apparently we deserved it where do i start i wish i had something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scenes the infamous scene were Ice Cube and co get in a fight with some really big really strong really really angry and scary looking Neo Nazis and win the neo Nazi where twice the size and the chase the chase is priceless This is NOT a movie about race tolerance and understanding it doesn t deliver this is a racist movie that re affirm all the clich stereotypes the white wimpy guy who gets manhandled by his black roommate automatically transform in a skinhead cmon simply awful I do regret ever seeing it Save your time and the dreadful experience of a poorly written poorly acted dull and clearly biased picture if you are into the subject go and Rent American History X now thats a movie
0	Towards the end of the movie I felt it was too technical I felt like I was in a classroom watching how our Navy performs rescues at sea I liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers I guess I should have figured that out before but I never thought about it Using a to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic The acting was pretty good since they re mostly seasoned professionals but if you re going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen it should be more like a fantasy comical etc Everything was taken too seriously At least the movie had Felix Ungar as pilot with Buck Rogers the night stalker and Dracula also on board The movie was filled with well known faces I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature That s why I said it should have been more comical My pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about They walk around with drinks setting them down and picking them up minutes later just as if they re in a building or something and acting as if turbulence just doesn t exist Also I know it s a disaster movie but suspense doesn t have to include a second crash after hitting something Anyway the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after it s first screening I like Lee Grant but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked
0	Well well well As good as John Carpenter s season outing in Masters of Horror was this is the complete opposite He certainly proved he was still a master of horror with Cigarette Burns but Pro Life is perhaps the worst I have seen from him It s stupid totally devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension and it overstays it s welcome despite the less than an hour running time The script is nonsense the characters are irritable and un appealing and the conclusion is beyond absurd And for those suckers who actually bought the DVD one of them being me did you see how Carpenter describes the film He s actually proud of it and he talks about it as his best work for a long time and he praises the script And in the commentary track where he notices an obvious screw up that made it to the final cut he just says he didn t feel it essential to rectify the mistake and he just let it be there I fear the old master has completely lost his touch I sincerely hope I m proved wrong I want to leave on a positive note and mention that the creature effects are awesome though Technically speaking this film is top notch with effective lighting schemes and make up effects
0	I think this is almost all I need to say I feel obliged to explain my actions though I ve basically never seen such an armateur production and I mean that in all senses of the word Although the physical camera work boom MIC operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable unfortunately its not the only areas Unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot this unfortunately has an awful script awful acting and worst of all awful annoying characters It s a crime that for the every independent film that gets distribution like Haiku Tunnel there s a other indie films that died silent deaths I don t know who the Kornbluth brothers know at Sony but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution I m quite bemused as to why they picked this up The ONLY part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title However the reason for that is even a let down I hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it I ve seen a lot of films in my time and I m very forgiving when in the cinema but this was too much I ll never forget tunnel for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema Shame it s such a low point
0	I watched this film few times and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it does not have anything to do with a real history facts Actors performances is very poor but it is result of limited acting possibilities Anyone who watched this film now probably think of Hitler as some crazy skinny lunatic who running with a gun like some Chicago gangster I can only to say that there is much better films about Hitler and Germany in those years and that Rise of evil is very much under average I can recommend German film Downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of Switzerland actor Bruno Ganz in a roll of Adolf Hitler
1	This well conceived and carefully researched documentary outlines the appalling case of the Chagos Islanders who it shows between and were forcibly deported en masse from their homeland through the collusion of the British and American governments Anglo American policy makers chose to so act due to their perception that the islands would be strategically vital bases for controlling the Indian Ocean through the projection of aerial and naval power At a time during the Cold War when most newly independent post colonial states were moving away from the Western orbit it seems British and American officials rather felt that allowing the islanders to decide the fate of the islands was not a viable option Instead they chose to effect the wholesale forcible removal of the native population The film shows that no provision was made for the islanders at the point of their ejection and that from the dockside in Mauritius where they were left the displaced Chagossian community fell into three decades of privation and in these new circumstances beset by homesickness they suffered substantially accelerated rates of death Following the passage of more than three decades however in recent months and years following the release of many utterly damning papers from Britain s Public Record Office one rather suspects that there was some mistake and these papers were not supposed to have ever been made public resultant legal appeals by the Chagossian community in exile have seen British courts consistently find in favour of the islanders and against the British State As such the astonishing and troubling conclusions drawn out in the film can only reasonably be seen as proved Nevertheless the governments of Great Britain and the United States have thus far made no commitment to return the islands to what the courts have definitively concluded are the rightful inhabitants This is a very worthwhile film for anyone to see but it is an important one for Britons and Americans to watch To be silent in the face of these facts is to be complicit in a thoroughly ugly crime
0	You ve gotta hand it to Steven Seagal whatever his other faults may be he does have good taste in women If you pick a Seagal movie chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it And usually they do not function as mere eye candy they get involved in the action and fight shoot guns kill with knives etc Flight of Fury offers the duo of Ciera Payton who has a very sexy face with luscious lips to match Angelina Jolie s and Katie Jones and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight AND a little lesbian fondling And if it seems like I m spending a little too much time talking about them it s because the rest of the movie although passable is so unexciting that it s hard to find much else to talk about Ironically the weakest aspect is probably Seagal himself who looks as if he can t even be bothered to try to pretend to care This being a military type actioner there is very little fighting in it and he doesn t fit into his role a stealth fighter pilot the best in the world of course very well which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking
1	Red Eye starts in Texas where hotel receptionist Lisa Reisert Rachel McAdams is about to catch the last red eye flight back to Miami where she lives works While waiting for her plane Lisa meets the handsome charming Jackson Rippner Cillian Murphy they both seem to hit it off then when they board the plane they discover that by a coincidence they are seated next to each other Once the plane takes off they are in the air Jackson reveals who he really is that their seemingly chance meeting was not a coincidence Jackson says that he is working for someone who wants to assassinate the homeland security secretary Charles Keefe Jack Scalia they need her to change his rooms at the hotel where she works in Miami Jackson tells Lisa to phone the hotel make it happen or her father will be killed Directed by Wes Craven who is perhaps better known for his horror films such as The Last House on the Left A Nightmare on Elm Street The Serpent and the Rainbow The People Under the Stairs the Scream trilogy of teen slashers a short punchy fast paced little thriller like Red Eye seems like a big departure from the sort of film Craven usually makes The script by Carl Ellsworth makes for a surprisingly gripping thriller that I must admit I really enjoyed at only odd minutes in length it s a very quick moving economical straight to the point sort of film that focuses almost entirely on one tight taught plot rather than go off in various directions with lots of subplots Some may like this approach like I did while other s may not but I think it draws you into the action a lot more as it comes thick fast without the film slowing down any giving you a chance to relax I really liked the plot for Red Eye sure a film like this is always going to have one or two questionable moments in terms of plotting but what the hell it s a film made to entertain for me that s what it did I really liked the two central character s Lisa comes across as very likable while Jackson Rippner an obvious play on the name of the notorious Victorian serial killer Jack the Ripper is a suitably slimy villain with a cold I m only doing my job type mentality Another plus point is that I didn t think anyone behaved overly stupid here everyone actually seemed like human beings the films plays out in a relatively plausible fashion I really liked this it s one of Craven s better more recent films Craven turns in a good solid tense tight taught fast paced thriller with an attractive cast some good action a gripping plot He certainly doesn t hang about once he starts the action tension he never lets up far away the most effective part of the film is when Rippner is holding Lisa hostage on the plane once the film switches to Miami Lisa s fathers house it does become a little bit more routine but it s still good A special mention goes to Rachel McAdams who is absolutely gorgeous in this I could probably watch Red Eye again just because she is in it looks drop dead stunning Those who see Wes Craven s name attached to Red Eye expecting a horror film should think again since there s no horror in it at all despite the IMDb listing Horror as Red Eye s genre I am not sure about the ending on the one hand it was nice to see the villain live for a change which goes against traditional expectation but it might have been more satisfying to see Lisa kill him in some way DreamWorks apparently gave Red Eye an initial budget of but reduced it to although it s still a very well made film with glossy production values Actually shot in Los Angeles Florida in California The film was supposedly written with husband wife Sean Penn Robin Wright Penn intended for the leads but eventually the makers opted for younger leads As I have already said Rachel McAdams is pure eye candy is a total babe in this worth watching the film for on her own Oh she puts in a decent performance too Red Eye is a really fast paced taught tension filled little thriller that I enjoyed immensely I didn t think I would enjoy it as much as I did I am glad I decided to watch it This definitely gets a recommendation from me Rachel McAdams really is hot stuff in this
1	A young woman who is a successful model and is also engaged to be married and who has twice attempted suicide in the past is chosen by a secretive and distant association of Catholic priests to be the next sentinel to the gateway to Hell which apparently goes through a creepy old but well maintained Brooklyn apartment building Its tenants take the stairway up and can reincarnate themselves but apparently can t escape as long as a sentinel is there to block the way The previous one John Carradine is about dead so she by fate or whatever becomes the next one and the doomed must get her to kill herself in order for them to be free Lots of interesting details lie under the surface her relationship with her father the stories of the doomed her fianc so one can pass this off as cheap exploitation horror but given the sets the great cast and overall level of bizarreness this is definitely worth seeing
1	Walking the tightrope between comedy and drama is one of the toughest acts in cinema How do you get laughs out of other people s misery and not start feeling bad when it goes on too long Well this surprising little gem of a movie will deliver great big laughs beautiful scenery and quite a good buzz as well I particularly like the concept that a trick of history made alcohol legal since white Europeans liked it and marijuana illegal since those other races used it undoubtedly true and exposes a racial side to the marijuana laws so openly flaunted by populations all over the world An extraordinary DVD Extra commentary two of them in fact run thru the whole movie with both the actors and then again with the writers I kept seeing things I was sure were not in the first movie but then realizing how easy it is to miss much of the subtle comedy on the first take What a hoot Don t miss it stars
0	Elizabeth Rohm was the weakest actress of all the Law and Order ADA s and her acting is even worse here Her attempts at a Texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic Nor can she adequately summon the intense emotions needed to play the mother of a kidnapped child at times while her daughter is missing she manages to sound only vaguely annoyed as if she can t remember where she left her keys This is an important true story so it s too bad that the awful acting of the lead actress distracts so much from the message The rest of the cast is talented enough but they just can t overcome Rohm s tendency to simply lay on a particularly thick imitation of a Southern drawl whenever actual acting is required
0	I saw this in the theater when it came out and just yesterday I saw it again on cable This I was able to reacquainted myself with the feeling of just how revolting this film is The whole bunch of characters are self absorbed narcisstic preeners Worst of all it reinforces every negative stereotype about something dating even as it purports to celebrate people finding themselves The nice guys finish last the jerky guys make out great the jerkiest guys do best The girls are all boy toy pushovers Only one character Wendy is seen doing anything remotely useful to society and she dispenses with her long saved virginity in a throwaway one night stand with a scumbag in a lushly filmed scene that we re supposed to think is romantic What this really is is Hollywood s concept of young America permissive detached promiscuous conceited
1	I have seen a couple movies on eating disorders but this one was definitely my favorite one The problem with the other ones was that the people with the eating disorders towards the end just automatically get better or accept the fact that they need help and thats it this movie I thought was more realistic cause in this one the main character Lexi doesn t automatically just get better She gets better and then has a drawback I think this movie shows more than the others that I ve seen that getting better doesn t just happen it s hard work and takes time it s a long path to recovery I think this movie shows all of that very well There should be more movies like this
1	The silent film the Pride of the Clan starring Mary Pickford was supposed to be set in a fictional island off the coast of Scotland In actuality most of the exterior shots were filmed in Marblehead Massachusett on Marblehead Neck near several rocky seaside geographic areas including the Churn and Castle Rock My initial interest in the film was because of two factors the Marblehead film location in my hometown and the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M Woodfin was hired as a stand in for Mary Pickford during filming of several scenes including the cliff scene Both women were small in stature and both my father and grandmother related the fact that she was a stand in with her back to the camera for the cliff scene as part of the Chiefton filming set I just wanted to relate this story for future film historians and buffs The film itself my DVD copy is somewhat poor is very well done with lots of action and expressive acting including several scenes where Miss Pickford portrays a strong woman characterization I enjoyed it and would love to get a better copy of it although I am unsure whether one exists as I have seen in various movie sites that remaining copies are dark because of deterioration A very nice film of the silent genre with lots of action
0	This was quite possibly the worst film I ve ever seen The plot didn t make a whole lot of sense and the acting was awful I m a big fan of Amber Benson I think she s usually a wonderful actress I can t imagine why she decided to do this film Her character Piper is drunk for almost the whole film with the exception of the opening scene On the plus side there was several points in the film where the acting was so bad I actually laughed out loud But despite that I would not recommend this film to anyone It s only minutes long but that s minutes of your life that you will have completely wasted
1	Red Rock West is one of those tight noir thrillers we rarely see anymore It s well paced well acted and doesn t leave us with loose ends or unanswered questions so typical in this genre Nicolas Cage stars as Michael an unemployed Texas roughneck desperate enough for a job to drive all the way to Wyoming for potential employment He is honest to a fault but always on the dark side of fate After failing to obtain gainful employment Michael stumbles into the Red Rock bar where the owner Wayne J T Walsh mistakes him for a contract killer he summoned from Dallas hired to do in his lovely but lethal wife Suzanne Lara Flynn Boyle Wayne gives Michael the necessary details and a down payment for the hit on the adulterous Suzie With no intent on following through Michael accepts the money and then sets out to warn Suzanne of her impending demise He also mails a letter to the local sheriff exposing the plot and splits As fate would dictate Michael is not going to be rid of the situation that easy While leaving in a violent rainstorm he runs down Suzannes lover Of course Michael being Michael he takes him to the local hospital where it s discovered that he s also been shot The sheriff is summoned and as luck would have it Wayne is also the local law Michael manages to escape while being taken on that last ride and is subsequently picked up by the real Lyle from Dallas played with murderous glee by the quirky Dennis Hopper After discovering that they re fellow marines Lyle insists that Michael join him for a drink at where else the Red Rock bar There Wayne realizes his mistake and soon he and Lyle are in hot pursuit of Michael who falls willingly into Suzannes waiting arms As the pace picks up we learn that Wayne and Suzanne are really wanted armed robbers on the lam for a multi million dollar theft Getting the money now becomes the films central focus with a series of betrayals double crosses and murders The film was very well cast Nicolas Cage was typically low key Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Bolye assumed their respective roles with more than ample ability The best performance was by the late J T Walsh who was menacing without appearing to be Walsh was a great character actor who left us much too soon Marc Reshoskys photography utilized many unique angles which added to the suspense and plot development The film was further enhanced by John Dahl s tight directorial style and Morris Chestnut s rapid fire editing
0	When a film has no fewer than FIVE different titles it usually means several things and almost always means that the film has major flaws somewhere Necromancy has major flaws and is just out and out bad I saw the version on video called Rosemary s Disciples Yes I am sure it differs from other versions but I am not inclined to think that in any way is any other version and the few more minutes it might have going to be really any better The story is perhaps the biggest problem the film opens with Laurie waking up and her husband taking her to a town where he has a new job at a toy factory for occultists yep it gets bad this early The town is called Lillith and has some guy with a rifle on the bridge to make sure only those selected by the owner of the town are allowed in Soon we find that everyone living in Lillith is a witch and all follow the directives of Mr Cato the head of this municipal coven who wants his dead son back hence the name Necromancy The people in the town do witch kind of stuff have ceremonies some like wearing a goat s head and promiscuity abounds not much really shown in this area but none of these people are very good actors Mr Cato is played robustly by the figuratively and literally larger than life movie maverick Orson Welles Welles is misused but make no mistake he is the best thing in this movie And that is really the saddest part of Necromancy as Welles gives a pretty poor and pedestrian performance with little directorial guidance In one scene at a party director Bert I Gordon keeps going back to Welles watching the action of the party using the exact same frames It looked ridiculous As did the scene that was repeatedly seen over and over again of a woman s arm centered in swirling flames after a car crash It looked like the arm of a shop mannequin The story is never fully utilized as we never really know what happens many scenes are shot like dreams or hallucinations and never confirmed This also applies to the corny hokey ending The lead Pamela Franklin is pert and pretty and has some talent Other than her performance real slim pickings from the rest of the cast sans Welles The direction and story were both done by Gordon who obviously had little gas left in the engine This is not a good movie in any way under any name
0	The Hamiltons tells the story of the four Hamilton siblings teenager Francis Cory Knauf twins Wendell Joseph McKelheer Darlene Mackenzie Firgens the eldest David Samuel who is now the surrogate parent in charge The Hamilton s move house a lot Franics is unsure why is unhappy with the way things are The fact that his brother s sister kidnap imprison murder people in the basement doesn t help relax or calm Francis nerves either Francis know s something just isn t right when he eventually finds out the truth things will never be the same again Co written co produced directed by Mitchell Altieri Phil Flores as The Butcher Brothers who s only other film director s credit so far is the April Fool s Day remake enough said this was one of the Films to Die For at the After Dark Horrorfest or whatever it s called in keeping with pretty much all the other s I ve seen I thought The Hamiltons was complete total utter crap I found the character s really poor very unlikable the slow moving story failed to capture my imagination or sustain my interest over it s a half minute too long minute duration The there s the awful twist at the end which had me laughing out loud there s this really big sustained build up to what s inside a cupboard thing in the Hamiltons basement it s eventually revealed to be a little boy with a teddy Is that really supposed to scare us Is that really supposed to shock us Is that really something that is supposed to have us talking about it as the end credits roll Is a harmless looking young boy the best twist ending that the makers could come up with The boring plot plods along it s never made clear where the Hamiltons get all their money from to buy new houses since none of them seem to work except David in a slaughterhouse I doubt that pays much or why they haven t been caught before now The script tries to mix in every day drama with potent horror it just does a terrible job of combining the two to the extent that neither aspect is memorable or effective A really bad film that I am struggling to say anything good about Despite being written directed by the extreme sounding Butcher Brothers there s no gore here there s a bit of blood splatter a few scenes of girls chained up in a basement but nothing you couldn t do at home yourself with a bottle of tomato ketchup a camcorder The film is neither scary since it s got a very middle class suburban setting there s zero atmosphere or mood There s a lesbian suggest incestuous kiss but The Hamiltons is low on the exploitation scale there s not much here for the horror crowd Filmed in Petaluma in California this has that modern low budget look about it it s not badly made but rather forgettable The acting by an unknown to me cast is nothing to write home about I can t say I ever felt anything for anyone The Hamiltons commits the cardinal sin of being both dull boring from which it never recovers Add to that an ultra thin story no gore a rubbish ending character s who you don t give a toss about you have a film that did not impress me at all
0	In one instant when it seemed to be getting interesting it never got there The people are going from one point to another point with really no point if there was one it was very dull There was no action suspense or any horror and the characters were pretty heartless so there was no caring what happened to them All together the movie was pretty boring I give it a I like that it wasn t shaky choppy camera work and if there was music it didn t annoy me like some really bad movies and the acting was not horrendous
1	Those of the Instant Gratification era of horror films will no doubt complain about this film s pace and lack of gratuitous effects and body count The fact is The Empty Acre is a good a example of how independent horror films should be done If you avoid the indie racks because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty somethings getting killed by some baddie whose back story could have come off the back of a Count Chocula box The Empty Acre is the movie for you Set in the decaying remnants of the rural American dream The Empty Acre is the tale of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six month old baby As the couple s weak relationship falls apart a larger story plays out in the background At night a shapeless dark mass seethes from a sun baked barren acre on their farm and seemingly devours anything in its path leaving no sign that it was ever there The film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues as to what is happening and ends with a well executed ending that resonates with just enough left over questions to validate the writer director s faith in an intellectual audience There seems to be a sub text concerning the death of the American dream but I would hardly call the film an allegory Riveting well acted and technically astute The Empty Acre is a fantastic little indie that thinking horror fans should love
1	SPOILERS Many different comedy series nowadays have at one point or another experimented with the idea of obscure independence In an early episode of cartoon Family Guy the Griffin family find their home is an independent nation to the United States of America and the story progresses from there Way back in however the Ealing Studios produced a wonderful little film along the same idea After a child s prank the residents of Pimlico discover a small fortune in treasure At the inquest it becomes clear that the small area is a small outcrop of the long lost state of Burgundy Withdrawing from London and the rest of Great Britain the residents of the small street experience the joys and the problems with being an independent state Based at a time when rationing was still in operation this story is brilliantly told and equally inspiring Featuring performances by Stanley Holloway Betty Warren Philip Stainton and a young Charles Hawtrey the film is well stocked with some of the finest actors of their generation These actors are well aided as well by a superb little script with some cracking lines Feeling remarkably fresh despite being over years old the story never feels awkward and always keeps the audience entertained Ealing Studios was one of the finest exporters of British film ever in existence With films like Passport to Pimlico it s not difficult to see why Amusing from start to finish the story is always fun and always worth watching
1	This movie is definitely on the list of my top favorites The voices for the animals are wonderful Sally Field and Michael J Fox are both brilliant as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch but the real standout is Don Ameche as the old faithful golden retriever This movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults Humorous and suspenseful and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry happy tears
0	If my memory is correct when this movie was released it came across as something of a comedy a funny look at the adult entertainment industry If that s what it s supposed to be it doesn t really work It just isn t that funny Setting that rather significant since this is called a comedy failure aside since I have no personal knowledge of the subject matter I ll avoid comment about the authenticity of the story which deals with the goings on behind the scenes in a Toronto massage parlour except to say that if this is true the life is pretty dull For over an hour this movie really doesn t give us much of anything except some background knowledge of the main characters Conrad is the newly hired manager of the massage parlour whose basic job apparently is to make sure the girls aren t giving full service a euphemism for actual sex As for the girls themselves Betty s goal is to buy a parlour of her own so that she can run her own business Cindy is an illegal immigrant to Canada working to support her family back home and Leah is well Leah is a somewhat strange undefined character with a nipple fetish true who seems to be in the business because well because she s in it I have no idea what her character was about Those three may well fairly reasonable composite characters who accurately represent the motivations of the women who get involved in this business The movie meanders about and doesn t offer much until the twist reveals Conrad to be the bad guy We should have gotten to that point sooner The only thing truly interesting here was that part of the story Conrad s secret plan and the revenge plotted against him by the girls That plan for revenge was pretty good and you re grateful when it comes out because basically up to that point you re wondering why you wasted your time with this Had the story been more focused on the revenge this might have actually been a fairly funny movie The performances from the leads were all OK although I didn t think anyone came across as outstanding All four characters were a bit shallow Cindy was a sympathetic character and so was Conrad for a while although he turns out to be the bad guy of the movie Given the subject matter there s surprisingly little nudity and what there is is restricted to one scene In fact there even a certain air of innocence around a lot of this As for the overall quality of the movie it s a low budget effort which shows although you expect a certain griminess I suppose of a movie set in the context of a body rub parlour so that s forgivable It certainly says something though that this was released years ago now and is still the only credit on writer director Soo Lyu s resume and given the normal lack of depth in the Canadian film industry that it wasn t even deemed worthy of being nominated for any Genie Awards the Canadian version of the Oscars and I m being a bit generous with that
0	There were times during the movie I wish I had been beat to death The only reason I endured the entirety of the movie was because I couldn t believe how bad it really was and thought it must get better This truly was a horror film I was horrified that I wasted what seemed like hours of my life that I will never get back The other two hours I spent mourning at the loss Please recommend this movie to whomever you wish to torture and tell them the suspense will kill them
1	From a modern sensibility it s sometimes hard to watch older films It s annoying to have to watch the stereotypical wallflower librarian have to take off her glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man Especially such a shallow and inconstant man He s obviously a player I wouldn t trust him to stay true to her who doesn t want to settle down who only looks at dumb attractive women and always calls them baby ick Even after she totally changes her appearance and her life for him he only goes to her after he s supposedly rejected by another woman and learns that Connie spent all her money renovating a boat for him I wanted her to stand up to him not pathetically chase after him His sudden conversion within a few minutes was totally unrealistic and did not work for me Apart from that subplot I did like the movie How can you not like sailors dancing with each other You can tell they were from San Francisco D The rehearsal dance was great watching Ginger Rogers purposefully fall in and out of the correct steps was great The last dance scene Face the Music with the beautiful costumes and the art deco set was beautiful And I really enjoyed We Saw the Sea though they did use it a few too many times as if they realized it was their best song Anyway the plot was a bit weak like most musicals IMO and the songs were OK but the dancing was worth watching the film for I wish they could have showed some shots of San Francisco since that was were the film was supposedly set It s also weird to see such a lighthearted naval film with the knowledge of what Hitler was already doing at that time I have to try to suspend all knowledge to submerge myself into a made up fantasy land
0	This movie is not that interesting except for the first ten minutes The pace and editing are a perfect introduction in an ensemble piece even better than say Gosford Park Then it inexplicably slows down loses focus and starts resembling a traditional French movie only to regain focus in the end with the love relation between Antoine Depardieu and C cile Deneuve In the middle there are too many sidelines and loose ends in the story several threads started are not ended SPOILERS AHEAD The main story is the relation between Antoine and C cile He has been loyal to her after his relation with her many years ago despite her remarrying and setting up home in Morocco As builder he now rebuilds his own life and recovers hers by taking the mask of C cile s marriage Having accomplished this he is buried after a freak accident literally and becomes a comatose He wakes only after she has burned their old picture as indication that they ve reconciled with the past and can properly start their lives again together END OF SPOILERSIt remains unclear what vision this director wants us to see us because there are so many other stories here Illegal immigrants want to enter Europe there are frequent radio broadcasts about the overthrow of Iraq s former regime C cile s child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs loyalty once he meets his boyfriend whereas the girl he lives with seems to be sick of that Her sister is traditional Islamic and enters a relation with C cile s husband It portrays Morocco as unnecessary backward despite all the building there is a strange colonial vision shining through that almost glorifies the past It portrays Islam as backward and prone to extremism which may sometimes be true but certainly not in general In the end it can all best be described as adding some couleur locale and l art pour l art Deneuve and Depardieu are great With this material they are so familiar they are able to spin something extra in every scene lifting an eyebrow body language radiating pride awkward behavior The movie itself is disappointing and only confirming the limited role of French cinema in the world nowadays With some notable exceptions of course
0	Really a terrible movie It s to be expected though Clearly a low budget nothing all that innovative an actress if you can call what she does acting who always has roles with nudity in a shower scene a man in a reptile suit almost modeled after predator a cabin in the woods etc But there are some redeeming points Although the story is not new for the most part there s a few parts that aren t so regurgitated For one the black guy doesn t die when he s attacked the first time and he isn t even one of the first couple to die But that s minor More importantly there s a very interesting twist regarding Kat s experiments and Wes Steve that I didn t see coming When Steve told Kat he knew what she did I believed what he said and what Kat replied with But when the creature revealed who he really was I was pleasantly surprised at the novelty of the revelation It could be because of my lack of experience with the genre or that it s a genuinely clever twist Either way the movie s pretty bad and don t watch it if there s anything better on Unless you re in the mood for a cheap scifi flick
1	Peter M Cohen has a winner satire on the mating game twisted around and turned inside out The critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media publications as offensive and raunchy only serves to underscore its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated dissection of people s sexual pursuits and passions It is in the tradition of what I call reality based satire following in the footsteps of In The Company of Men Chasing Amy Your Friends and Neighbors and Two Girls and a Guy Cohen s dialogue is hilarious and I was continually intrigued by how perfectly he captured the real pace of today s conversations Brian Van Holt Zorie Barber and Jonathan Abrahams are three distinct unrelenting sex obsessed predators who along with the foil of their recently married buddy superbly played by Judah Domke are turned upside down on their own terms by a female predator Amanda Peet Underneath the satiric surface lurks a romantic comedy far more satisfying than most sugar coated studio products
1	I ve watched a bunch of episodes of Cold Case since its premiered especially now that it immediately follows The Amazing Race but this was one of the best instances of writing and acting I ve seen from the house of Bruckheimer The casting especially of the younger officers was spot on and the script and editing the soundtrack and the acting made this episode a tour d force If I were the producers I would submit this episode for Emmy consideration It amazing how complete a portrait was made of Coop and Jimmy within the confines of s minute episode that takes a lot of talented people doing their best I hope there s is advance warning of when this episode is repeated because I m sure I ll notice a lot that I did not notice the first time around
0	I frequently comment on the utter dirth of truly scary movies on the market and sadly White Noise only served to reduce my faith that the film industry remains capable of such an endeavor I was surprised to find myself growingly increasingly fatigued as the plot wore on and my static induced headache increased I found White Noise to be preposterous beyond our best efforts of suspension of disbelief Even after witnessing the harrowing ordeal sustained by Michael Keaton I was totally unaffected by his demise Up until the credits I diligently awaited for something anything of substance to connect me to the characters story but such relief never came Sure there were the occasional heart stopper moments but only because loud noises tend to do that to the dozing viewer While the acting was lame Michael Keaton may have played his studliest role to date Perhaps the only redeeming quality that White Noise has to offer is the stunning archietecture in both of Keaton s abodes Overall White Noise leaves one with the morbidly depressing idea that those who die are trapped in a world guarded by three malicious shadows contriving to trick the living into following the dead to their own graves
0	While I certainly consider The Exorcist to be a horror classic I have to admit that I don t hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do As a consequence of that I haven t seen many of The Exorcist rip offs and if Exorcismo is anything to go by I ll have to say that s a good thing as this film is boring as hell and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on it In fairness to the other Exorcist rip offs this is often considered one of the worst and so maybe it wasn t the best place for me to start It s not hard to guess what the plot will be basically it s the same as the one in The Exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit which happens to be the spirit of her dead father The village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism Like many Spanish horror films this one stars Paul Naschy who is pretty much the best thing about the film Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch who previously directed the derivative Spanish Giallo The Killer Wore Gloves I haven t seen any of his other films but on the basis of these two I believe that originality wasn t one of his strong points There s not a lot of good things I can say about the film itself it mostly just plods along and the exorcism scene isn t worth waiting for I certainly don t recommend it
0	Lame plot and two dimensional script made characters look like cardboard cut outs Needless to say this made it difficult to feel empathy for any of the characters especially the fianc He looked and acted more like a cartoon In summary I guess you could say it was on par with your typical made for TV drama It uses just about every clich in the book The tortured classical musician who wants to break out and play salsa The free spirited fianc e engaged to a bean counter personality she doesn t love I won t list them or else it would be a spoiler because I d be giving away the whole plot The dancing was OK but nothing special I ve seen worse stars for good music The band was really tight I saw it on YouTube Thankfully I didn t pay good money to see it at a theater I m still a little shocked at how many great reviews this movie has garnished
0	Abysmal with a capital A This has got to be one of if not THE unfunniest show on TV right now I m about as anti bush as it gets but this show doesn t even get a chuckle out of me What you think of Bush as a president has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether or not you ll like this piece of crap show The jokes are not funny at all For example in a scene when lil bush has his underwear on his head Welcome to camp al qa eeda There is NOTHING funny about that Is it even supposed to be joke The commercials that were shown in the weeks leading up to the show hyping it up were funnier than the show itself and that s just sad Hopefully this does not even get considered for a second season It shouldn t even have had a first
1	This movie is great If you enjoy watching B class movies that is This is a classic college s slasher movie in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack A horrible film but worth renting to make fun of or just to watch old men pop out of closets with knives Kinda funny if you ask me
0	If the only sex you ve ever had is with a farm animal then the tag line for this movie is probably still misleading This is by far one of the most boring movies I ve had the pleasure to try and watch lately I found the DVD lying around at my friend s house and I made the sad mistake of not burning it I am unable to tell any details without spoiling the movie because there are only about details to this movie Just try to imagine someone making a movie about things on c span only the fictional movie is times less interesting than the most boring debate on c span I think there is a conspiracy somewhere in this movie but I was unable to tell exactly what it was after I gouched my eyeballs out and threw them at Richard Gere
0	The Vampire Bat is definitely of interest being one of the early genre setting horror films of the s but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praise The film is set in a European village sometime in the th Century where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals There is a very similar feel to James Whale s Frankenstein and this is compounded by the introduction of Lionel Atwill s Dr Niemann character complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancement The vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red herring by having suspicion fall on bat loving village simpleton Herman Dwight Frye thus providing the excuse for a torch wielding mob to go on the rampage as if they needed one This is one of a trio of early horror films in which Lional Atwill and Fay Wray co starred also Doctor X and The Mystery of the Wax Museum and like their other collaborations the film suffers from ill advised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements Taken in context though The Vampire Bat is still weak and derivative All we are left with is a poor quality Frankenstein imitation with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink Dracula fans But for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director Frank Strayer was doing the Blondie films a few years later
1	Tweaked a little bit Nothing could be a children s film It s a very clever concept touches upon some interesting metaphysical themes and goes against pretty much every Hollywood convention you can think of what goes against everything more than literally nothing Nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives All that s left is what they don t hate and a big empty white space It s hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot It focuses on pretty much one subject but that s prime Vincenzo Natali territory If you ve seen Cube you know already that he tends to like that type of situation The nothing in this movie is apparently infinite space but Natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic if only because there s literally nothing else and nowhere else to go The actors sell it although you can tell these guys are friends anyway Two actors from Cube return here Worth and Kazan but are entirely different characters They change throughout the story and while they re not the strongest actors in the world they re at least believable The reason I say this could be a children s film under the right tweaks is because aside from a few f bombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence the whimsical and often silly feel of this movie could very much be digested easily by kids So I find it an odd choice that the writers decided to add some crass language and a small amount of gore especially considering there isn t very much of it This could ve gotten a PG rating easily had they simply cut a few things out and changed a little dialogue There is very little objectionable about this film but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it I only say that s a shame because not because I support censorship but because that may have been the only thing preventing this movie from having wider exposure At any rate this is a reasonably entertaining film albeit with a few dragged out scenes But for literally being about nothing and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film
1	The movie Atlantis The Lost Empire is a shining gem in the rubble of films produced by the Disney Studios recently Parents who have had to sit through The Jungle Book or even a Pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one The film is one of few to attempt at an original story previous feature films were merely re tellings of existing stories Films such as Toy Story Finding Nemo and Monsters Inc all do the same but it must be noted that all were made by Pixar and only distributed by Disney Recent films from the Disney Studios are mostly released direct to video and are sequels to an existing successful film The quality of those films is given way to the profitability A new era started with Atlantis following it were Mulan Lilo Stitch and most recently Open Range The writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the past A good portion of the movie is devoted to the quest to find Atlantis a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years Including that of young Milo Thatch voiced by Michael J Fox Milo is employed by a museum in Washington D C His grandfather was a renowned archaeologist who had devoted his life to discovering Atlantis This was seen as a waste by his peers and they wish Milo to not follow in his footsteps After failing to convince the museum board of directors to sponsor his expedition Milo comes home to find a woman in his darkened apartment She takes him to her employer a Mr Whitmore Whitmore was a close friend of Milo s grandfather and wishes to send Milo with a team to locate Atlantis Mr Whitmore is very wealth and has paid for the best of everything The crew that is to accompany him is the same as his grandfathers The journey is filled with many great obstacles to overcome and is great fun to watch The viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach Atlantis The plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery Atlantis not just the discovery of people It is enough to keep the interest of the older audience The animators have done a wonderful job in then depth of the animation The movie is very successful in blending traditional animation with Computer Generated Images A feat not easily achieved most audiences are quick to notice the difference in the two The characters are believably human There are some nice chase type scenes with lots of action going on A few lulls are filled with jokes that the children just may not get The creativity of the writers really shines through The culture of Atlantis is richly developed including an entire language The film uses references to Atlantis from historical sources such as Plato The disappearance of Atlantis from the world is explained Believable if by a younger audience that magic really does exist The powers of the people of Atlantis are not exactly presented as magic but can best be described in this way Although set in the level of technology used is unrealistic The voyage is in a submarine very reminiscent of Captain Nemo s nautilus complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes The giant diggers are driven by steam boilers so they did try for some era technology The female characters are empowered in a way that women of the age would not have been even holding roles in leadership This is not a bad thing It gives a good role model for my daughter to look to rather than an all male cast One reason this film is a favorite of mine over other Disney films is that there is not one single song ever A tradition that began with the first feature film Snow White and carried on through to The Lion King almost every Disney film is full of upbeat songs This is great and all what would the Seven Dwarfs be without Hi HO After the millionth time through it d almost be better without but this one spares the parent Not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and break out in song I for one am grateful The storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike It is a film I am willing to watch again and again with my children
1	Greetings again from the darkness Much anticipated twisted comedy from writer director Richard Shepard is a coming out party for Pierce Brosnan the actor That Bond guy is gone This new guy is something else entirely Have read that Shepard thought Brosnan was too much the pretty boy for this plum role but Brosnan proves to be the perfect Julian Noble Facilitator and is anything but pretty Do not underestimate how twisted the humor is in this one If you go expect punch lines and sight gags regarding all types of sex killing religion sports business and anything else you might deem politically incorrect Brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his marvelous facial gestures and physical movements Even sitting on a hotel bed with or without a sombrero is a joy to behold Greg Kinnear is the straight guy to Brosnan s comic and has plenty of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click Hope Davis has a small but subtly effective supporting role as Kinnear s wife what s with her name Bean who happens to get a little excited when she has a facilitator in her living room The visuals and settings are perfect including a bullfight racetrack and Denver suburb And how often do we get The Killers and Xavier Cugat on the same soundtrack This one is definitely not for everyone but if your sense of humor is a bit off center and you enjoy risky film making it could be for you
0	SEVEN POUNDS EMOTIONALLY FLAT ILLOGICAL MORALLY DISTURBINGThe movie was distributed in Italy as Seven Souls I was curious about the original title and after some research I found out that it refers to Shakespeare s Merchant of Venice where the usurer Shylock makes a terrible bond with the merchant Antonio who will have to give him a pound of his flesh in case he is not able to repay his debt Whereas the Italian translation makes Ben s plan something deeply human characterized by human sympathy the original one though cultivated enough to remain unperceived by anyone makes it just in its reference to the flesh something cold rational deep rooted in the physical side of man Unfortunately I think that the real quality of Ben s plan is revealed by the original title it a a cold machination aimed at donating parts of his body but lacking any authentic human empathy at least the audience is not given the chance to see or perceive any pure relation of souls within the whole movie The only exception is the love story with the girl which seems to be a sort of non programmed incident to which Ben yields but incapable of conveying true emotional involvement I really didn t like the idea at the core of the movie the idea that a person however devoured by the pain for the death of his beloved and of other people he himself has caused takes the resolute decision to expiate his sense of guilt through suicide besides being improbable it makes no sense I would have liked and I think it would have been more positive if in the end Ben had decided to abandon the idea of committing suicide and go on living thus helping those same people and maybe many more just standing near them and helping them through his presence He wouldn t have saved their lives miraculously of course this would have probably caused more suffering but I think it could have been more constructive from a human and moral point of view There are many illogical and disturbing things the initial reference to God s creation in seven days which by the way according to the Bible are six what does it mean And what about a woman suffering from heart disease which prevents her from running and even from singing without feeling bad who can have normal sex with a man who feeling as it should be destroyed by the death of his wife and having donated organs and pieces of his body doesn t seem to feel so much tried both emotionally and physically from his impaired condition The movie is saved by good acting but all the rest is pure nonsense not only from a logical point of view but also from a human and emotional one
1	Deathtrap gives you a twist at every turn every single turn in fact its biggest problem is that there are so many twists that you never really get oriented in the film and it often doesn t make any sense although they do usually catch you by surprise The story is very good except for the fact that it has so many twists The screenplay is very good with great dialogue and characters but you can t catch all the development because of the twists The performances particularly by Caine are amazing The direction is very good Sidney Lumet can direct The visual effects are fair but than again most are actually in a play and are fake Twists way to much but still works and is worth watching
1	While I do not think this was a perfect I do agree it was way above a which is what it s rated here No Brokedown Palace was not perfect and yes it s plot has been done many times before That doesn t mean it shouldn t be done again if it is done well and I think this movie had some strong moments The acting of Claire Danes as already mentioned many times was flawless as was Kate Beckinsell and I Think Bill Pullman was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performances Pullman s wife the crooked cop skip or trip or whatever his name is The cinematography was also beautifully filmed there was a lot that s good to this movie even if there were some negatives three major ones that I found as well Here is what I didn t like about it the friendship between the girls In fact the girls own individual personalities were not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic It would not have been improbable to lose interest before then because despite the positives more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much Jumping around without the character and scene development I think would have been appropriate for this type of film That however is not my major problem And WARNING SPOILER ALERT The ending as mentioned dozens of times already was AWFUL It was awful in two respects Firstly even though it would have been predictable and very Hollywood I wanted a happy ending Yes it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this there is a Sense that justice will be served and I did sit through it to see that I was Genuinely shocked at the ending and It was performed with excellence by all involved but I feel both girls should have got out or barring that at least the cop should have got what was coming to him I mean nothing happens To the bad guys they all get away with it Very disturbing Also I do not understand the ambiguity of the ending I understand endings that are inspired to make one think but this was not a mystery or Clue type movie we were watching and I would have liked to know something about what actually happened who was guilty etc with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since I somehow doubt there will be a sequel I did not want to be kept guessing Still there was a lot to like about this movie and the acting is definitely at the top of the list I would rate this a and say it is definitely worth a look
0	On the way back from IMC San Jose California all five mind you three of us hardcore Kamal fans of us had reached a unanimous verdict VV was solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up Monday Not to mention we swore to stay off the theatres for the next year I won t blame Kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist Madan on Vijay TV He said something like Tamizh Cinema la Photography Editing la namba munnera na maadri Screenplay Direction Acting la innum namba munnera la Tamil Cinema has grown in terms of Photography and Editing but we have hardly improved when it comes to Screenplay Direction and Acting While you re watching VV those words ring very true Now here are the Reasons to hate this movie Harris Jeyaraj Harris Jeyaraj Harris Jeyaraj I m barely holding myself from using expletives here but fact is HJ has mastered the fine knack of screwing up every recent movie of his remember Anniyan Ghajini with the jarring cacophony he bills as background music The next time I have an eardrum transplant he s paying for it Songs Neither do the songs help move the movie s narration spatially temporally nor do they make you sit up and take notice The film feels like it s made of four VERY long songs with a few scenes thrown in between them A Short gone too far VV at best is fit to be a short story not a hour plus thriller To use a clich here like the Energizer bunny it goes on and on and on only in this case you don t want it to The later part of a movie feels like a big drag Kamal Jothika pairing Two ice cubes rubbed together could ve produced more sparks than this lead pairing There s no reason you would root for them to make it together In fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie they make a good irritant to the narration Hate to say this but Kamalini Mukerjhee s minute romancing does more than what Kamal and Jothika achieve in this movie plus Thenali Kamal Haasan s accent Kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in India or in the US and it isn t new either He s been doing it since Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae It s simply gets on the nerve Imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meets shooting on location in the US He doesn t leave it at the Immigration either he offers doses of advice to his men bewildered TN Cops from Keeranor Sathoor and beyond in chaste Kamanglish Wha we hav here is plain bad police wok of course with nauseating effect Logic There are a few directors whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale Gautam fails us badly with some crappy performance in the Department of common sense Which D C P in his senses would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss such matters as committing himself and life after The scene inside the theatre was so bad towards the climax we could hear people behind us loudly challenge the Hero s IQ Is he stupid can t he just use his Siren or Lights On a busy Madras road Kamal the cop on a police Jeep chases a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude Can t he just use his gun The guy on a bike starts on foot and we have a fully geared Kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time I m not voting in favour of the later but I m just trying to explain the mood inside Gore Violence If I wanted to watch women being raped their throats getting slashed more women getting raped and thrown into the bushes with excruciating authenticity I would sit at home and rather watch a Police Report or Kuttram The use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story not overwhelm it Somewhere down the line Gautum seems confused about what the extensions rapes murders are and what the mainstay story is Even a double shot Espresso couldn t get the pain out of the head
0	It seems the makers of this film had trouble deciding what their message really was Consequently they had even more trouble delivering it They began by poorly describing principles of quantum physics which relate to sub atomic particles Having established a fuzzy picture of Heisenberg s Uncertainty Principle they presented a barrage of talking heads who built a case of ridiculous logic intimating that every living person is an entity which follows the same quantum rules on a cosmic scale Then there was a lot of talk about ideas upon which Stephen Covey and Tony Robbins have made their careers positive thinking interrupting bad patterns always look on the bright side etc Next came a bit about how our brains can change our bodies through production of proteins hormones which we more or less choose to create If you are sad you will create sad proteins If you are happy you will create happy proteins It s just so simple isn t it Interwoven with our lessons we follow the fictitious life of Amanda a photographer who pops anti depressants and hates her thighs The film makers slowly but surely were trying to get us all to say Hey Amanda just cheer up Why can t she cheer up Obviously it s because the world is a BAD place where there is crime and poverty and religion that s why The conclusion of the film which is basically the entire second half brought on a barrage of contradiction We are all a part of a whole energy where we are not beings but a collective consciousness but we are individuals who can change the world but there are many of each of us because of all the different dimensions but we can choose who we are and we have a purpose to do good but there is no god because there is nothing better than us so there is no such thing as right and wrong so there is no such thing as reward or punishment so nothing good ever came out of religion but we should still do good anyway even though there is no such thing as bad and good because there is nobody to decide what that is except for the fact that we each can make life good if we all meditate and then crime will cease and if we say nice things our water will freeze into pretty shapes Still with me Good because there is more According to Robert L Park in his book Voodoo Science the whole meditation experiment put on by John Hagelin in Washington D C was a farce the numbers were doctored and the murder rate was higher that year that any year before or since And what about your positive attitude keeping you young and healthy This was a message delivered by an older man who looked his age and a woman who was overweight So does all this work or not I was lucky enough to see the film at a theater where Betsy Chasse one of the film s three directors yes three fielded questions following the show I call myself lucky because I had first hand confirmation that these people don t know what they are talking about Several of the questions asked by audience members had her so stumped that her husband a chiropractor had to step in and recite the answer I finally had to leave when the discussion inevitably turned political and everyone including Ms Chasse began speculating as to how wonderful the world would be if only President Bush could see this movie
0	I remember Devil Dog playing on TBS almost years ago and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day It s not that bad for a made for TV horror movie but it is derivative mostly of The Exorcist and businesslike for lack of a better word It won t blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting but it s not a waste of time either It s the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren t in the mood to think too hard However if you go into the movie looking for some laughs you won t be disappointed The early scenes with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with Children of the Damned eyes are hilariously non threatening and the climactic blue screen effects of a giant black dog with horns are pretty side splitting And keep an eye out for the cloaked Satanist in Maverick shades toward the beginning Not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination but I wish they still made stuff like this for TV
1	I saw this movie only after hearing raves about it for years Needless to say the actual experience proved a bit anticlimactic But still Alec Guiness energetically leads a wonderful cast in a jolly if formulaic romp through industrial post WWII England This is the familiar tale of the woes of inventing the perfect everyday product Remember the car that runs on water Remember the promise of nuclear energy In this case it s a fabric that doesn t wear out wrinkle or even get dirty Of course fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified at the prospect of being put out of business and so the plot gets a bit thick Guiness makes the whole enterprise worthwhile and watching him blow up a factory research lab over and over again is quite a blast Those Brits always the stiff upper lip when under fire The film might chug along exactly like Guiness s goofy invention but it s a good ride all the same
0	Documentary about nomadic Persians making a treacherous traverse of massive mountains to get their herds to grass Watching this silent black and white feature marred in part by a twink twink twink Oriental music score that could not have been used in the original exhibition is even duller than it sounds The spectacular scenery is lost on a small black and white screen and there is an utter failure to establish any kind of plot line I loved Nanook of the North and March of the Penguins but despised this movie notwithstanding the similarity of the theme Physical hardships alone are just not that interesting
0	I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision on TNT Even he couldn t make this movie enjoyable The only reason I watched it until the end is because I teach video production and I wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though It s like watching your great grandmother flirting with a year old boy excruciatingly painful If you took the actual film dipped it in paint thinner then watched it it would be more entertaining Seriously If you see this movie in the bargin bin at S Mart back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake
0	Dr Hackenstein begins at the turn of last century The dawn of modern medical science to be exact Dr Eliot Hackenstein David Muir is in the early stages of his rejuvenation of living tissue experiments Dr Hackenstein manages to bring a skinned rat back to life which confirms he has succeeded in bringing the dead back to life It s now Three years later Dean Slesinger Micheal Ensign is round the Doc s house for dinner As Dean Slesinger Dr Hackenstein eat they talk about Hackenstien s experiments which Dean Slesinger has always been opposed to Dr Hackenstein shows Dean Slesinger his laboratory in his attic where he keeps the severed head of his wife Sheila Sylvia Lee Baker who died in an unfortunate accident can telepathically talk to him Christy Botkin provides Sheila s voice apparently Dr Hackenstein also show s Dean Slesinger a skinned chicken running around in a cage explains that with the process he has developed he will bring Sheila back to life The Dean has some sort of seizure apparently dies Meanwhile sisters Wendy Bambi Darro as Dyanne DiRossario Leslie Trilling Catherine Davis Cox plus their Brother Alex John Alexis their cousin Melanie Victor Stacey Travis are driving along near Hackenstein s house when they crash they seek shelter assistance arrive upon Hackenstein s doorstep Dr Hackenstein invites the four stranded travellers to stay for the night Later on Dr Hackenstein is visited by two grave robbers Xavier Logan Ramsey Ruby Rhodes Ann Ramsey who deliver a male body when Hackenstein actually needs female parts for Sheila Dr Hackenstein being the genius that he is decides not to waste the opportunity of having three young beautiful specimens available starts to borrow the bits n pieces he needs to complete Sheila Written directed by Richard Clark I was pleasantly surprised by Dr Hackenstein I ll state right now that it ain t brilliant by any stretch of the imagination but for what it was I actually quite liked it It moves at a reasonable pace even if it does tend to drag a little bit during it s middle as things settle down The script tries to mix slapstick humour like a scene when Dr Hackenstein is trying to restrain Melanie she tries to gain the attention of his deaf housekeeper Yolanda Simpson Catherine Cahn by kicking out Hackenstein keeping Melanie behind Yolanda s back who is seemingly oblivious to what s happening with a touch of gore but I d say Dr Hackenstein is more of a comedy than horror in conception feel throughout There are some tacky puns sexual innuendo as well which are always good for a laugh Dr Hackenstein to Wendy would you like to see my instruments as an example I also thought the scene when Mrs Trilling Phyllis Diller reports her missing daughter s to the bemused detective Olin William Schreiner was a pretty amusing sequence going round in circle s talking about why he isn t looking for them even though he has only just been told why the cell doesn t have a prisoner in it that if he didn t find the cousin not to worry about it None of it s flat laugh out loud but I must admit I found myself smiling on occasion found the film as whole to be quietly amusing There isn t a lot of on screen gore a few severed limbs Sheila s decapitated head some medical stitching those skinned animals which are definitely fake by the way I liked the characters in Dr Hackenstein too which was surprise in itself The acting isn t brilliant but to give everyone credit they put some effort into it lots of exaggerated facial movements some serious overacting means it s never dull oh the three birds in Dr Hackenstein are fit if you know what I mean Technically the film is OK as well once again it ain t going to win any Oscars but I have to give the filmmakers at least some credit for trying to pull off a turn of the century period setting It doesn t always work the clothes are at odds with each other at times the girls look like their from Victorian England while the guys look like their from a western The house looks as if all the filmmakers did was remove any modern object from the room stick a few candles in there It comes across as a little bit on the cheap side but it really isn t a bad looking film at all considering Could have done without the comedy music though Overall I ended up enjoying Dr Hackenstein much more than I thought I would although that in itself isn t a recommendation It s certainly is not the best comedy horror film ever made it certainly is not the worst either A watchable enough piece of harmless fun
0	Former brat pack actor and all round pretty boy Rob Lowe stars in a film set in a high security American prison I had a gut feeling his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons like Tobias in the first series of OZ but PROXIMITY isn t that kind of film it s more like a Man on the run film like THE FUGITIVE It also makes a nod to the themes of punishment and justice with James Coburn putting in a cameo as the spokesman for a justice for victims pressure group but any intelligent discussion on how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film degenerates into tired old cliches of shoot outs and car chases
1	The problem is that the movie rode in on the coattails of the s created concept that comic books could only be done as camp i e the s Batman show for TV and movie Thus you have combat sequences with subtitles come on a cluelessly unromantic Doc Savage he was uncomfortable around women in the pulps not an idiot Monk Mayfair in a nightsheet a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy encased in gold like a Herve Villechez posing for an Oscar statute And when they re not doing booming Sousa march scores the tinkly little funny music undercuts much of the drama Even as such this movie is okay It s fun and when it stays serious it s a very accurate representation of the pulps Except for Monk as has been mentioned before he s hugely muscled not obese And Long Tom who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude not Paul Gleason with an inexplicable scarf The Green Death sequences for instance are remarkably gruesome and not something I d recommend for children But they are very close to the feel of the pulps When the writers and producers get it right they do get it right I ll give them that But if the producers had done Doc with the loving care and scripting of say Reeves first two Superman movies think what we might have had then I think the problem is the movie s schizophrenic There s a definite sense of trying to do a s homage but they re also trying to give in to the heroes must be camp attitude that Batman created One gets the impression there was a sober pulp style first draft and then someone came in and said Hey let s make it funny it worked with the Batman show years ago But Doc lives on thanks to Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai If MacRauch ain t doing a homage to Doc Savage in that movie the man is truly demented So when the series actually gets on TV allegedly mid season in Doc Savage updated to the s will live once more
1	At first sight this movie doesn t look like a particular great one After all a Bette Davis movies with only votes on IMDb and a rating of must be a rather bad one But the movie turned out to be a delightful and original surprise You would at first expect that this is a normal average typical s movie with a formulaic love story but the movie is surprisingly well constructed and has an unusual and original story which also helps to make this movie a very pleasant one to watch The story is carried by its two main characters played by Bette Davis and George Brent Their helped by a cast of mostly amusing characters but the movie mainly involves just around them two Their character are involved in a most unusual and clever written love story that work humorous as well It makes this movie a delightful little comedy to watch that is perfectly entertaining The movie is quite short just over an hour long which means that the story doesn t waste any time on needless plot lines development and characters It makes the movie also rather fast paced which helps to make this movie a perfectly watchable one by todays standards as well It does perhaps makes the movie a bit of a simple one at times but this never goes at the expense of its entertainment or fun A delightful pleasant simple romantic comedy that deserves to be seen by more
1	Not one of your harder hitting stories and that s a real strength of this film There are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some all too predictable romantic tension They not only spare the audience this but throw in some surprises at the same time There are a few Disney ish moments particularly near the end but they are manageable Overall it was worth the rental and it was good relaxed fun BTW if you get the DVD watch the segment where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi We followed her directions and it was BRILLIANT Next time we will make it the day before we plan to eat it because this is one dish that definitely gets better with a full night in the fridge to let the spices out
1	My child my sister dream How sweet all things would seem Were we in that kind land to live together And there love slow and long There love and die among Those scenes that image you that sumptuous weather Charles Baudelaire Based on the novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim Enachanted April can be described in one sentence it takes place in the early s when four London women four strangers decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April It is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that Enchanted April an ultimate feel good movie is perfection of its genre Lovely and sunny tender and peaceful kind and magical it is like a ray of sun on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever This is the movie that actually affected my life I watched it during the difficult times when I was lost unhappy and very lonely when I had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself It helped me to regain my optimism and hope that anything could be changed and anything is possible I had promised to myself then that no matter what I would pull myself out of misery and self pity and I would appreciate every minute of life with its joy and its sadness I promised myself that I would go to Italy and later that year I did and I was not alone Charming enchanting and heartwarming Enchanted April is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love This little film is a diamond of highest quality
0	What more can I say The acting was almost without exception amateurish The directing and continuity were pitiful The sceenplay was predictable down to the very last scene and the dialog tedious One of the features on the DVD was labeled Gag Reel but that could have been a description of a viewer s reaction to most of the movie One of the most amusing things was in the director s comments on the DVD He said with a straight face that he had set out to make a movie with high production values and a name cast and that he had succeeded With delusions like that it s easy to understand how the movie turned out as it did Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster The darkwolf suit was a modified ape suit per the making of feature on the DVD and rather looked it The mask and claws were little better than off the shelf jobs from any costume store The cgi effects were painfully obvious and of quality similar to an inexpensive video game
0	Carriers follows the exploits of two guys and two gals in a stolen Mercedes with the words road warrior on the hood hightailing it down the highway for the beach with surfboards strapped to the top of their car Brian Chris Pine of Star Trek is driving and his girlfriend Bobby Piper Perabo of Coyote Ugly has shotgun while Brian s younger brother Danny Lou Taylor Pucci of Fanboys and his friend not exactly girlfriend Kate Emily VanCamp of The Ring occupy the backseat This quartet of twentysomething characters are living in a nightmare Apparently a viral pandemic which co directors co scenarists Alex Pastor and David Pastor tell us absolutely nothing about has devastated America Naturally the lack of exposition shaves off at least fifteen minutes that would have slowed down this cynical melodrama about how humans degenerate in a crisis and become their own worst enemies This lethal virus gives you the shingles and then you bleed and die Most everybody runs around wearing those white masks strapped to their nose and mouth by a thin rubber band Initially this foursome encounters a desperate father Frank Christopher Meloni of Runaway Bride and his cute little daughter Jodie Kiernan Shipka of Land of the Lost blocking the highway with their SUV Brian swerves around Frank when he tries to waylay them but in the process the oil pan in their Mercedes ruptures and they wind up on foot Reluctantly they hitch a ride with Frank after they seal Jodie up in the rear of the SUV She wears a mask over her nose and mouth and it is speckled with blood Frank has heard that doctors are curing ailing people at a hospital and they head to it Sadly somebody has lied to Frank The hospital physician is giving the last couple of kids some Kool Aid that will put them out of their misery The cure did not improve their condition Everybody else in town is dead Kate tries without success to get a dial tone on every phone Frank realizes that there is no hope for his daughter and he lets the heroic quartet appropriate his SUV and take off Indeed Carriers qualifies as a relentlessly depressing movie about the effects of a pandemic on four sympathetic people who degenerate into homicidal murderers to protect themselves They reach a country club and frolic around on a golf course until another four show up in suits and masks with pump action shotguns Incredibly our protagonists manage to escape without getting shot but Brian has a scare when he almost falls into the water with a floating corpse Eventually they discover that one of them has become infected Later as they are about to run out of gas Brian blocks the highway like Frank did at the outset Danny tries to stop a pair of older Christian women driving the car Danny lies that his pregnant wife is about to give birth and he needs their help Brian throws caution to the wind and blasts away at the ladies with his automatic pistol when they refuse to help them Brian catches a slug in the leg from the passenger but he kills her No Carriers is not a beer pizza movie that you can either laugh off or laugh with because the humor is virtually non existent By the end of this minute movie our heroes have turned into villains who only care only for themselves and their plight Chris Pine makes quite an impression as fun loving Brian and his energetic performance is the only reason to hang with this hokum while the only other well known actress Piper Perabo is relegated to an inconsequential girlfriend role As Bobby she makes tragic the mistake of showing compassion to a dying little girl and pays an awful price It is a testament to Pine s performance that he can change his character to the point of putting himself before others Essentially Pine has the only role that gives him the ability to pull a one eighty from happy go lucky guy to heartless guy The two directors are Spanish brothers and they never let the momentum flag Since there is no relief in sight Carriers sinks into predictability Irr versible cinematographer Beno t Debie does a fantastic job with his widescreen lensing and as unsavory as this road trip becomes Debie makes it look like a dynamic film Aside from the lack of a happy ending or closure in any sense of the word Carriers suffers because it is so horribly cynical The scene when the German shepherd attacks Danny conjures up the most suspense but even it could have been improved Unfortunately the Pastor brothers do not scare up either much tension or suspense By fade out you really don t care what happens to anybody
0	A romanticised and thoroughly false vision of unemployment from a middle class artist with a comfortable upbringing It is clear that the writer director never suffered unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience of it If you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers have no anger no fear no frustration etc All the characters live trough the day by carrying pranks boyish jokes They do never look for work the do almost never experience rejection or anguish etc Living on the dole is just about like a summer vacation from school Ridiculous Specially if you compare it with contemporary masterpieces from the likes of Ken Loach etc
1	I really enjoyed Girl Fight It something I could watch over and over again The acting was Fantastic and i thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the film Very convincing might I say The movie is showing how women should stand up for what they want to do in life She had so much compassion and yet so much hate at the same time Dealing with a ignorant dad didn t really help her much Even though he loved her he was really hateful Her mother died when she was younger and that also put some sadness in the role The love story was a part that i really enjoyed in the movie also I felt the passion the y had for one another Then again drama sets in and then its like she is choosing between her boyfriend and her life long dream I thought it ended just right It was the kind of ending where you have to decide what happened in the future for them For all you people who likes a movie based on a sport with a good plot i d suggest that you check this one out
1	I rank this the best of the Zorro chapterplays The exciting musical score adds punch to an exciting screen play There is an excellent supporting cast and mystery villain that will keep you guessing until the final chapter Reed Hadley does a fine job as Don Diego and his alter ego Zorro Last but certainly not least is the great directing team of Whitney and English
0	SCARECROWS seems to be a botched horror meets supernatural film A group of thugs pull off a paramilitary like robbery of the payroll at Camp Pendleton in California They high jack a cargo plane kidnapping the pilot and his daughter with demands to be flown to Mexico Along the way one greedy robber decides to bailout with the money landing in a cornfield monitored by strange looking scarecrows These aren t just any run of the mill scarecrows they can kill The acting is no better than the horrible dialog And the attempts at humor are not funny Very low budget and shot entirely in the dark The cast includes Ted Vernon Michael David Simms Kristina Sanborn B J Turner Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian

1	Origins of the Care Bears their Cousins If you saw the original film you ll notice a discrepancy The Cousins are raised with the Care Bears rather than meeting them later However I have no problems with that preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations The babies are adorable and it s fun watching them play and grow My favourite is Swift Heart Rabbit The villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter I could empathise with the three children since I was never good at sports either Cree Summer is excellent as Christy The songs are sweet and memorable If you have an open heart love the toys or enjoyed the original this is not to be missed
0	The peculiar charisma of Martin Kosleck brings a certain believability to his character of the frustrated artist He imbues his dialog with an odd sense of realism making the sculptor Marcel a convincing individual The character manages to come across as a real person and not so much a typical B movie villain The story line is nothing to write home about and many scenes are dull What makes it work is the strange chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton as the Creeper Kosleck s talkative philosophical character is contrasted with Hatton s low key monosyllabic approach The character of the Creeper isn t developed much beyond a basic monster level but Hatton suggests undeveloped possibilities and makes you wonder about his back story This movie was on Shock Theater a lot when I was a kid so I have a certain nostalgic fondness for it It s worth seeing once anyway for those who enjoy Forties horror movies
1	I thought the racism and prejudice against Carl Brashear was grossly overdramatized for Hollywood effect I do not believe the U S Navy was ever that overtly racist I cannot imagine a full Captain the Commanding Officer ever telling his Chief to intentionally flunk anyone Certainly not at the risk of his life And there has never been a Chief Petty Officer as unabashedly prejudice against everybody but WASPs as DeNiro s character No Chief as slovenly and drunken as he was played would have ever risen to Master Chief in the first place Cuba Gooding saved an otherwise badly done movie
1	If you want to remember MJ this is a good place to start This movie features sweet tunes MJ as robot and a crazy messed up plot I recall many a night passing out to this fine feature film in college and pondering the sheer awesomenes of whoever decided to green light this ridiculous piece of There is lots of singing Lots of dancing There is lots of singing while dancing MJ slays it as you would expect when it comes to this stuff But there is much more to this movie There is claymation There are fat children clay There is an anthropomorphic rabbit that michael jackson has to battle in a dance off obviously clay too There is Joe Pesci as well not made of clay RIP we love you Michael It is a sad day for all of us
1	This movie is one of the many Kung Fu action films made in Asia in the late s early s full of cheap sound effects dubbed dialog and lightning fast martial arts action But unlike most films of this genre it also has a decent plot and lots of great comedy When workers of a dye factory are forced out of their jobs by Manchu bullies they hire a con artist Gordon Liu to try to scare them off When his attempt fails miserably he cons his way into a Shaolin temple to learn to fight for real But instead of making him a Kung Fu student the Master instead orders him to build a scaffolding to cover the roofs of all chambers Well it turns out that while he s performing these menial tasks stacking and tying bamboo poles that he s learning the skills to be a Kung Fu expert It s sort of like in Karate Kid when Mr Miagi teaches Daniel the basics of karate by having him do routine household chores Wax on wax off et cetera There s lots of great comedy from beginning to end and plenty of action at the end when Gordon Liu once again faces his Manchu tormentors This time it s not just tricks it s the real thing Liu declares proudly thumping his chest If you like classic Kung Fu films you don t want to miss this one
0	This was one of the most boring movies I ve ever seen I don t really know why Just your run of the mill stories about guy who is about to get married and starts to fancy someone else instead Story has been told a thousand times Nothing new or innovative about it at all I don t really know what was wrong with this film Most of the time when these kinds of actors actresses get together to make a film that have already been made a million times before it s really entertaining There are usually little clever thing in them that aren t really in any other For some reason this one just doesn t hold your attention You can pick out some funny parts or clever ideas in it but for some reason they re just not funny nor clever in any way I wish I new how to explain it but I don t Just don t waste your time on this one
0	I just got through watching this DVD at home We love Westerns so my husband rented it He started apologizing to me half way through The saddles costumes accents everything was off The part that made me so mad is where the guy didn t shoot the collector with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guy s soul His only excuse was he only had arrows left We watched it all the way through and as someone else said too many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked I mean the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found what s the point of that And why were there a grave yard where everyone died on April but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around If you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers this may be your movie However if you want a real Western you will hate this movie
1	This familiar story of an older man younger woman is surprisingly hard edged Bikers hippies free love and jail bait mix surprisingly well in this forgotten black and white indie effort Lead actress Patricia Wymer as the titular Candy gives the finest performance of her career spanning all of drive in epics Wymer was precocious and fetching in THE YOUNG GRADUATES but gives a more serious performance in THE BABYSITTER The occasional violence and periodic nudity are somewhat surprising but well handled by the director Leads Wymer and George E Carey sell the May December romance believably There are enough similarities between THE BABYSITTER and THE YOUNG GRADUATES to make one wonder if the same director helmed the latter film as well Patricia Wymer where are you Hailing from Seattle WA Miss Wymer had appeared as a dancer on the TV rock and roll show MALIBU U before gracing the cover as well as appearing in an eight page spread of the August issue of Best For Men a tasteful adults only magazine She also appeared as a coven witch in the popular cult drive in shocker THE WITCHMAKER THE BABYSITTER has finally made its home video debut as part of the eight film BCI box set DRIVE IN CULT CLASSICS vol which is available from Amazon com and some retail stores such as Best Buy
0	I m a Christian I have always been skeptical about movies made by Christians however As a rule they are know nothings when it comes to movie production I admire TBN for trying to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen However they did a hideous job of it The acting was horrible and unless one is familiar with the Bible in some fashion one COULD NOT have understood what the movie was trying to get across Not only was the movie terribly made but the people who made it even had some facts wrong However in this critique those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into In short the Omega Code is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen and I would not recommend it to anyone except for comic relief from the every day grind
1	The first step to getting off of that road that leads to nowhere is recognizing that you re on it in the first place then it becomes a matter of being assertive and taking positive steps to overcome the negative influences in your life that may have put you on that road to begin with Which is exactly what a young Latino girl does in Girlfight written and directed by Karyn Kusama Diana Michelle Rodriguez is an eighteen year old High School senior from the projects in Brooklyn facing expulsion after her fourth fight in the halls since the beginning of the semester She affects a whatever attitude which masks a deep seated anger that threatens to take her into places she d rather not go She lives with her father Sandro Paul Calderon with whom she has a very tentative relationship and her younger brother Tiny Ray Santiago With her life teetering on the brink of dissolution she desperately needs an outlet through which to channel the demons that plague her And one day she finds it without even looking for it when she stops by the gym where Tiny trains Ironically Tiny wants nothing to do with boxing he wants to go to art school but Sandro is determined that his son should be able to take care of himself on the streets and pays the ten dollars a week it costs for his lessons When Diana convinces Tiny s trainer Hector Jaime Tirelli to take her on and approaches her father for the money under the guise of calling it a weekly allowance she doesn t want him to know what she wants the money for Sandro turns her down and tells her to go out and earn her own money Ultimately with Tiny s help she finds a way and the ring soon becomes her second home It s an environment to which she readily adapts and it appears that her life is about to take a turn for the better And the fact that she will have to fight men not women in gender blind competitions does not faze her in the least Diana has found her element First time writer director Karyn Kusama has done a terrific job of creating a realistic setting for her story presenting an honest portrait of life in the projects and conveying that desperation so familiar to so many young people who find themselves in dead end situations and on that road that leads to nowhere And there s no candy coating on it either as Hector tells Diana when she asks him how he came to be where he is I was a fighter once I lost Then looking around the busy gym Like most of these guys they re going to lose too But it s all they know And it s that honesty of attitude as well as the way in which the characters are portrayed that makes this movie as good as it is It s a bleak world underscored by the dimly lit run down gym you can fairly smell the sweat of the boxers and that sense of desolation that hangs over it all like a pall blanketing these people who are grasping and hanging on to the one and only thing they have all that they know Making her screen debut Michelle Rodriguez is perfectly cast as Diana infusing her with a depth and brooding intensity that fairly radiates off of her in waves She is so real that it makes you wonder how much of it is really Rodriguez exactly where does the actor leave off and the character begin Whatever it is it works It s a powerful memorable performance by an actor from whom we will await another endeavor with great anticipation She certainly makes Diana a positive role model one in whom many hopefully will find inspiration and the realization that there are alternative paths available in life at least to those who would seek them out As positive as this film is however it ends on something of an ambiguous note though Diana obviously has her feet on the ground there s no indication of where she s headed Is this a short term fix for her or is she destined to become the female counterpart of Hector After all realistically and in light of the fact that the realism is one of the strengths of this film professional boxing isn t exactly a profession that lends itself to nor opens it s arms to women And in keeping with the subject matter of the film and the approach of the filmmaker an affirmation of the results of Diana s assertiveness would have been appropriate The supporting cast includes Santiago Douglas Adrian Elisa Bocanegra Marisol Alicia Ashley Ricki and Thomas Barbour Ira Though it delivers a very real picture of life to which many will be able to identify there are certain aspects of Girlfight that stretch credibility a bit regarding some of what happens in the ring That aside it s a positive film that for the most part is a satisfying experience I rate this one
0	I picked up this video after reading the text on the box the story seemed good and it had Keanu Reeves But after minutes of watching I noticed how horrible his acting was he walks and talks so stupid the whole time it s fake and not convincing It doesn t end there almost ALL the characters act so badly it s laughable the only acceptable acting was by Alan Boyce David but the guy commits suicide early on and you don t see him again you never even know why he did it Everything about this movie screams low quality I can t believe how such a thing gets released I was tempted many times to stop watching in fact I did half way through it I decided to stop watching and turned the thing off came to the IMDB to check what other s thought about it I found zero comments not surprised so I decided to force myself to handle the pain and go back to finish it then come here to comment on it The only good thing going for me was the high school Rock band theme the occasional guitar playing and singing parts but that s not worth it Very bad acting and directing Terrible movie
0	This film is absolutely horrific One of the worst movies I ve ever seen The story does nearly not exist the characters are full of stereotypes and the Special FX only make you laugh The only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of the Rapper Coolio as some kind of police officer If this film was supposed to be a comedy I didn t quite get the point If you want to watch this movie please get yourself drunk first and then prepare for some good laughs especially when the first Special FX appear on the screen But if you like trash movies made on the cheap this film is a must see for you
0	This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen It is not funny It is not interesting and should not have been made
1	I picked this one up on a whim from the library and was very pleasantly surprised Lots of tight expressionistic camera work an equally tight script and two superb actors all meld together to make one very fine piece of film Not for the reptilian multiplex brain but rather the true aficionado of cinema If Hollywood ever does get its grimy hands on it I m sure it will ruin it A choice treat all the way around Other posters here have more than amply sung its praises so I needn t bother duplicating their paeans just take their advice and mine and don t miss this gem Call it what you like I call it two hours of entertainment well spent Read my lips don t miss it
1	I was quite a fan of the series as a child and after that it has always remained in my mind as one of those memorable cartoons that made a difference in the early s compared to previous animated series Heidi Barbapapa Il Etait une Fois l Homme most of which I love I find that other similar Japanese cartoons of this kind released later can t match Mazinger Z as they started to boringly repeat the same pattern That very thing the novelty may be one of the best features of Mazinger Z Another good point is its inventiveness with so many extravagant monsters strange devices and bizarre characters actually we were eager to see each new installment to find out what kind of new fiend or evil machine was awaiting us
0	This could well be the worst film I ve ever seen Despite what Mikshelt claims this movie isn t even close to being historically accurate It starts badly and then it s all downhill from there We have Hitler s father cursing his own bad luck on the fact that he d married his niece They were in fact second cousins Hitler s mother Klara called his father Alois uncle because Alois had been adopted and raised by Klara s grandfather and brought up as his son when he was really his nephew Alois was much older than Klara and so as a child she d got into the habit of calling Alois uncle The scene in the trenches where Hitler is mocked by his fellow soldiers and decides to take it out on his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of all viewers We see Hitler chase the dog through the trench when he catches up with the poor thing he proceeds to thrash it for disobeying him In the distance we see and hear his fellow soldiers continue to mock and chastise the cowardly little man but then a shell lands directly on his persecutors and every last one we are told is killed outright How then if Hitler was the only person to survive the scene did this tale of brutality and cowardice come to be told Did Hitler himself go around boasting about it I don t think so Next up Hitler bullies and intimidates a poor stressed out and war weary Jewish officer into giving him an Iron Cross I can only assume that this Jewish officer had been a pawnbroker before fighting for the Fatherland and had thoughtfully brought along some pledged medals from his shop because I m certain that Iron Crosses were not being handed out as shown in this comic farce All the grotesque clich s are here not least the calming and hypnotic effect of Wagner s music upon the little man If only the producers had kept Ian Kershaw on side Then they might have discovered that Franz Lehar s Merry Widow was more likely to float the Fuhrer s boat than any Flying Dutchman from the cannon of Richard Wagner Hitler may have been responsible for the deaths of million people but how can he ever be forgiven for his appalling taste in music I could go on but I d be at it for hours Give it a miss
0	The Good Earth is not a great film by any means it is way to ordinary Maybe it was different in the s but who would want to see the life of a farmer It is not very interesting to me Yes Luis Rainer and Paul Muni do an excellent job acting but the film dragged on way too long I could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act In short Wang Lung Muni a small time farmer who does not want to be like his own father turns out exactly like him Both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death beds The film does a complete going from one generation to the next Also this film did not have any good character actors or funny moments it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis
1	I saw this when it premiered and just re watched it on IFC again This is a great telling of the many possible stories about the immigrant farmworker population that came to Hawai i to work the sugar plantations in the early s My grandparents were part of that migration my parents were born on a Kohala plantation Big Island at the time setting of the movie I moved to the Big Island over a year ago after living in California for over years I was surprised to see that many of the former cane growing lands are still undeveloped with wild cane still growing years after the plantations closed I ve heard many stories from my aunts and uncles who were kids growing up on the plantation This movie helps to image those kinds of stories and memories This story is more of an historical document than a romantic plot driven movie It leaves me shaking my head to read a review like ccthemovieman s Some people just don t get it I didn t recall that Youki Kudoh had the starring role with which she did an incredible job I recall her great performances in Jim Jarmusch s Mystery Train and in an Australian film co starring with Russell Crowe Heaven s Burning Tamlyn Tomita did a great job with her pidgin English especially for someone who didn t grow up in the Islands I had forgotten that Toshiro Mifune had a cameo role as the moving picture show narrator And I missed the fact that Jason Scott Lee had an uncredited non speaking part as one of the plantation workers during the payday scene I was saddened to find out that the director and co writer Kayo Hatta died in an accidental drowning in There are two other excellent foreign films that mirror this cane plantation experience Gaijin about the immigrant cane workers in Brazil many of them Japanese in the same time period and Sugar Cane Alley about the cane plantation experience in Africa The latter is still available but Gaijin sadly doesn t appear to have been shown in quite a while Another great film about the early Asian in America experience when immigrants were more like slaves is A Thousand Pieces of Gold This was set over the Chinese workers involvement in the building of the railroad starred Rosalind Chao Chris Cooper Michael Paul Chan and Dennis Dun
1	Here s a decent mid s horror flick about a gate of Hell in NYC that just happens to be an old brownstone Seems like there s lots of gates of Hell around but of course this unwitting model happens to decide she needs some space from her boyfriend fianc e and so she just happens to pick one which is disguised as a nice and reasonably priced apartment She meets several strange neighbors and even attends a birthday party for a cat Upon meeting with the Realtor because she hears strange noises at night from upstairs she finds out that she and an old priest are SUPPOSED to be the only tenants Whoa Then who are all these weirdos Her boyfriend a slimy lawyer played by Chris Sarandon starts poking around and finds that things are not what they seem not by a long shot This has some decent creepy scenes and the idea of the creaky old folks that are her sometimes neighbors being other than what they appear is fairly intriguing A bit of decent gore and even a parade of less than normal folks towards the end make this a decent watch and while I ve seen this many times on TV the uncut DVD version is much better of course Not a bad little horror flick maybe a good companion piece to Burnt Offerings out of
0	The movie starts out as an ordinary comic hero movie It s about the boy who is picked on has no parents and is madly in love with the schools girl Nothing surprises in the movie there is nothing that you can t guess coming in the movie Toby Mcguire shows us that either he is no good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this one Maybe kids around the age of ten can enjoy the film but it is a bit violent for the youngest You can t get away from thinking of movies like X men Batman and Spawn All of those titles are better I almost walked out the last minutes One thing that could have been good though was the computeranimation BUT not even that is anything to put in the christmas tree So my recomendation Don t see this film even if you get paid for it
0	Any one who saw the original would have to go out and destroy this dreadful remake Alex Baldwin trying to imitate the late Steve Mcqueen in a word for word remake just doesn t work While Baldwin has done some admirable work this is a flop from start to finish McQueen had charisma never try to compete with a star As for Kim in the role of Ali McGraw enough said McQueen looked dangerous menacing and believable as Doc the film had excitement and suspense Baldwin and company made this into a comedy I laughed the one and only time I saw this miserable film And that dreadful hairstyle for Michael Madsen who is one of today s more exciting and believable actors Did the makeup people have it in for Michael what were they thinking If you wish to see movie making the way it was under Sam Peckinpah s direction Get the original
1	Movie comedies nowadays are generally minutes of toilet humor foul language and groin kicking Modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator the undemanding and slow of brain Sure an occasional good comedy will come along but they re becoming rarer all the time Mr Blandings Buildings his Dream House shows what s Hollywood was capable of and it s just screamingly funny Jim and Muriel Blandings Cary Grant and Myrna Loy decide to build a house in the Connecticut suburbs The film follows their story beginning with house hunting trips the house s riotous construction all the way to the finished home with its zuzz zuzz water softener Grant and Loy are perfect for their roles of course Grant is particularly funny as he watches the house s costs zoom out of control However the film is stolen by the Blandings wise attorney played to perfection by Melvyn Douglas Managing to steal every scene he s in Douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the Blandings lurch from crisis to crisis Reginald Denny as the Blandings harried architect and Harry Shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful I ve watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh I think it s a good film to watch when you need a lift whether you re building a house or not
1	Laurence Olivier Merle Oberon Ralph Richardson and Binnie Barnes star in The Divorce of Lady X a comedy based on a play Olivier plays a young barrister Everard Logan who allows Oberon to spend the night in his hotel room when the London fog is too dense for guests at a costume ball to go home The next day a friend of his Lord Mere Richardson announces that his wife Barnes spent the night with another man at the same hotel and he wants to divorce her Believing the woman to be Oberon Olivier panics Oberon who is single and the granddaughter of a judge pretends that she s the lady in question Lady Mere when she s really Leslie Steele We ve seen this plot or variations thereof dozens of time With this cast it s delightful I mean Richardson and Olivier Olivier and Oberon that great team in Wuthering Heights Pretty special Olivier is devastatingly handsome and does a great job with the comedy as he portrays the uptight nervous barrister Oberon gives her role the right light touch She looks extremely young here fuller in the face with Jean Harlow eyebrows and a very different hairdo for her She wears some beautiful street clothes though her first gown looks like a birthday cake and in one gown she tries on with that hair do she s ready to play Snow White Binnie Barnes is delightful as the real Lady Mere The color in this is a mess and as others have mentioned it could really use a restoration Definitely worth seeing
0	The prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of Nietzche s work and personality psychoanalytical techniques and Vienna s history Take a well know genius you have not read describe him as demented include crazy physicians to cure him a couple of somewhat good looking women have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache have every character speak with the strongest accent show ridiculous dreams include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one Freud mention a few words used in the genius works overdo everything you can particularly music and you are done Audience please stay away
0	Once again I took a chance and rented this bag of crap Billed as a horror flick there wasn t one scene not one that was even remotely scarey NOT ONE Sure there was some nudity but all the lesbian action got a little old I guess maybe that was suppose to be this movie s saving grace And Dan what an annoying ass bag Right from the beginning I knew I was in for it when good ol Dan first spoke And he was suppose to be intimidating What a laugh All in all this movie is dreadfully awful How in the hell do movies like this get made If you want a movie with a few thrills in it don t rent this one This movie is about as thrilling as the Teletubbies
1	Before I watched this tv movie I did not know much about one of my favorite actresses After watching it I realized how sad Lucille Ball s life really was It had it s great moments too but I didn t realize how sad it was This movie was very good and told the story of the beloved Lucille Ball very well I highly reccommend it
1	I hadn t seen this film in probably years so when I recently noticed that it was going to be on television cable again for the first time in a very long time it is not available on video I made sure I didn t miss it And unlike so many other films that seem to lose their luster when finally viewed again I found the visual images from the Pride of the Marines were as vivid and effective as I first remembered What makes this movie so special anyway Everything Based on the true story of Al Schmid and his fellow Marine machine gun crew s ordeal at the Battle of the Tenaru River on Guadalcanal in November the screenplay stays true to the book upon which it was based Al Schmid Marine by Roger Butterfield varying only enough to meet the time constrains of a motion picture This is not a typical war movie where the action is central and indeed the war scene is a brief minutes or so in the middle of the film But it is a memorable minutes filmed in the lowest light possible to depict a night battle and is devoid of the mock heroics or falseness that usually plagues the genre In a way probably ahead of its time the natural drama of what happened there was more than sufficient to convey to the audience the stark ugly brutal nature of battle and probably shocked audiences when it was seen right after the war This film isn t about glorifying war I can t imagine anyone seeing that battle scene and WANTING to enlist in the service Not right away anyway What this film really concerns is the aftermath of battle and how damaged men can learn to re claim their lives There s an excellent hospital scene where a dozen men discuss this and I feel that s another reason why the film was so so well received it was exceptionally well written There s a dream sequence done in inverse negative film that seems almost experimental and the acting is strong too led by John Garfield Garfield was perfect for the role because his natural temperament and Schmid s were nearly the same and Garfield met Schmid and even lived with him for a while to learn as much as he could about the man and his role Actors don t do that much anymore but added to the equation it s just another reason why this movie succeeds in telling such a difficult unattractive story
0	There seems to be an overwhelming response to this movie yet no one with the insight to critique its methodology which is extremely flawed It simply continues to propogate journalistic style analysis which is that it plays off of the audiences lack of knowledge and prejudice in order to evoke an emotional decry and outburst of negative diatribe Journalism tell the viewer some fact only in order to predispose them into drawing conclusions which are predictable for instance the idea of civil war chaos looting etc were all supposedly unexpected responses to the collapse of governmental infrastructure following Hussein s demise were these not all symptomatic of an already destitute culture doctrinal infighting as symptomatic of these veins of Islam itself rather than a failure in police force to restrain and secure would they rather the US have declared marshall law i m sure the papers here would ve exploded with accusations of a police state and fascist force aside from the analytical idiocy of the film it takes a few sideliners and leaves the rest out claiming so and so refused to be interviewed yet the questions they would ve asked are no doubt already answered by the hundred inquisitions those individuals have already received would you as vice president deign to be interviewed by a first time writer producer which was most certainly already amped to twist your words they couldn t roll tape of Condi to actually show her opinion and answer some of the logistics of the questions perhaps they never watched her hearing this is far from a neutral glimpse of the situation on the ground there this is another biased asinine approach by journalists which are by and large unthinking herds anyone wanting to comment on war ought at least have based their ideas on things a little more reliable than NBC coverage and CNN commentary these interpretations smack of the same vitriol which simply creates a further bipartisanism of those who want to think and those who want to be told by the media what to think
0	This Naschy outing is directed by Leon Klimovsky and a cursory glance at the publicity photos and packaging might lead you to believe that this medieval romp lies somewhere between Inquisition and Sadomania Sadly not This is a strictly PG affair with tame torture sequences no nudity and little edge at all Naschy of whom I am a fan struts his stuff as Gilles de Lancre antiguo Mariscal de la nacion Sadly he is more pantomime villain than anything else One gets the feeling with this film that we have seen him and it done all before Strictly therefore for Naschy completest only
0	I go to the cinema to be entertained There is absolutely nothing entertaining about this film From beginning to end there is no respite from the gray grinding reality of this woman s life It is one paced with no change of mood I remained until the end only because I was convinced that things must get better They don t and I don t think I was the only one as evidenced by the many groans ringing around the cinema as the film drew mercifully to a close Honestly depicting social depravation is no crime but boring your audience to groans is not the way to win the sympathy of the public A dreadful film
1	I make just one apology for this film there are far far too many wide angle close ups and if they irritate you beyond endurance fair enough They drove ME barmy for the first ten minutes or so But after that I made a kind of a truce with the terrible cinematography and long before the end of the film I had ceased to care This is too rich a comedy to be destroyed so easily It s hilarious it s witty the comic delivery of ALL of the cast is flawless and however much Usher peers at his characters through a cold fish eye lens HE may not care for them much he manages to present them with warmth Mystery Men is in fact not only funnier not only more clever but also deeper than anyone seems to have given it credit for being The jokes in the Austin Powers movies for instance as well as being less funny than the jokes here are also much more toothless The satire of Mystery Men bites when there s something worth biting and gnaws gently when there isn t It doesn t mock just any old thing Which is why contrary to what some I must regard them as unobservant critics have said it never runs out of ideas The super heroes are an attractive bunch Sure they re second rate but they re not merely second rate The Blue Rajah for instance does nothing but throw cutlery at people and he isn t THAT good at it On the other hand neither is he comically bad He s better in his limited field than most people and he DOES practise diligently He s not a buffoon which makes him a much funnier character than if he was If Superman is Christ in a cape the Mystery Men are all the minor demigods from the foothills of Mount Olympus in capes Much funnier also much more endearing
1	A funny comedy from beginning to end There are several hilarious scenes but it s also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me Creative story line with a very talented cast I thoroughly enjoyed it
0	As horror fans we all know that blind rentals are a crap shoot Sometimes we find a real gem but many times we find that the film we ve just spent our hard earned money on is nothing more than a putrid steamer made worse by the completely undeserved rave reviews and film fest awards listed on the box Such is the case with Five Across the Eyes a title I m sure is a double entendre referring to both the films budget and the compulsion anyone watching it might have to using all five fingers to stab their eyes out The story or at least what the ahem writers think passes for one centers on a group of teen girls who unwisely decide to go on a backwoods joyride late at night after leaving a football game and run afoul of a crazy woman who plays cat and mouse with them as punishment for what she thinks the girls found in her car after a fender bender in a gas station parking lot In fairness it s an interesting idea Some of the best horrors have very simple story lines It s in the execution of Five Across the Eyes that this idea falls flat The film tries to be a cross between The Blair Witch Project with its shaky camera work and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in its bare bones approach to the material but succeeds at being neither What we get instead are redundant scenes of chase torture release chase torture release in that order for minutes with long interludes of bitching moaning and incoherent rambling acting as plenty of padding in between chase sequences The look of the film is incredibly grainy and dark which in a better made film might have enhanced the tension and the realism Here it s merely annoying The characters are undeveloped and the viewer is hard pressed to find anything to sympathize with them One character stops to get a first aid kit and tend to some scrapes on her face while gunshots heard in the background indicate her friends may be getting killed Another girl mutters hilariously dumb lines like Don t go out there she ll get you if she gets you she ll kill you and if she kill s you you re dead It was an accolade from Fangoria magazine and Dreadcentral com listed on the box that compelled me to check this one out Talk about a fake orgasm Perhaps my expectations would have been met had this been in the comedy section I m all for low budget Indie horror but this one takes the crap cake Give Five Across the Eyes or FATE get it a pass RazorFriendly gives FATE slash out of five
1	The interesting aspect of The Apprentice is it demonstrates that the traditional job interview and resume do not necessarily predict teamwork skills task dedication and job performance And they certainly don t reveal any hidden agendas In other words a good indicator of potential may be to see a job applicant in action which is the point of The Apprentice People vying for a corporate position may hand over a sugar coated resume and put on their best personality attire for the interview but these are not necessarily the best indicator of strengths weaknesses and performance Briefly The Apprentice involves job candidates competing for the ultimate career opportunity a position in real estate magnate Donald Trump s investment company The Apprentice refers to the winner who will win a salaried position learn the art of high stakes deal making from the master himself and presumably gain prime corporate connections The position is a dream come true for those wanting to make more money than the GNP of some foreign countries To entice the candidates Trump shows off his private jet his private luxury apartments replete with statues and artwork his limos his connections to celebrities and other aspects of the life of a billionaire magnate The road to success is not easy The group is divided into two teams that compete against each other Each has a corporate sounding name such as Versacorps and Prot g Corporation The teams are assigned tasks that entail an entrepreneurial venture such as creating advertising selling merchandise or negotiating Teams select a project manager who provides the leadership and organizational skills to complete the task If they win the manager receives a lot of credit particularly in the eyes of the final arbiter If they lose the manager may also become the scape goat Some of the tasks are monumentally difficult with only a day or two to complete Tasks may involve creating a TV commercial or print ad Others may involve selling at a retail outlet or on the street The tasks bring out the best and worst in the participants They often show immediately who is the most reliable who is the most trustworthy and who is hard working And the tasks also expose who is not a good team player who is inefficient and who seems only out for themselves The tasks invariably reveal in unexpected ways the strengths and weaknesses of the participants and in particular the project manager How well the manager communicates with the team delegates work organizes time and sets specific goals will largely determine the outcome but it does not necessarily predict the winner The single most telling aspect of someone s potential is when he or she is assigned as a project manager Their real abilities as opposed to their self propagated abilities immediately show through the veneer that cannot be hidden by a silk tie or a beautiful makeover Leadership qualities and or weaknesses often become agonizingly obvious after only a few minutes Those promoting themselves as top notch leaders are not always as strong when put into a real life leadership situation It is always easier to toot your own horn than to actually engage in leadership Project managers even those on the winning teams often do not formulate a cohesive strategy They often believe that by diving off the deep end to complete the task at the first minute rather than taking a little time to organize and discuss how the task will be completed is more efficient More often than not members of an ill strategized team are running around like headless chickens figuring it out as they go along and in the long run they end up wasting far more time The winning team gets a taste of the high life such as eating dinner at an exclusive restaurant flying in a private jet and or meeting a celebrity The losing team comes to the dreaded board room where Trump hears the lame excuses of the members and knocks off one or more of the contestants like pieces off a chess board with the now infamous You re fired Often the project manager is held partially responsible for the team s loss and may be the target of Trump s accusatory rhetoric Every week at least one person becomes a casualty from the losing team My least favorite aspect of The Apprentice is the board room While the tasks themselves bring out the strengths and weaknesses in the candidates the board room often brings out the worst Unfortunately the rules of the game insist there is one winning team and one losing team even if the competition was close Members of the losing team start accusing each other often ruthlessly about who was at fault And sometimes more than one person gets fired I seldom see an under performing candidate take responsibility for their actions in the board room Kristi Frank and Kwame Jackson were possibly the only candidates who took full responsibility for her team s losses and received no recognition for this selfless act For me Kristi Frank and Kwame Jackson had the most integrity of all the candidates However Trump saw Kristi as weak and fired her claiming she wasn t standing up for herself which may mean he values ego more than integrity No one should sacrifice their integrity for this Kristi Frank may not have become the apprentice but she can live with herself knowing she did not blame others unjustly Isn t that worth as much as winning The strength of The Apprentice is also its weakness Because team performance is evaluated strictly by winners and losers other evaluation opportunities are overlooked Barring huge gaps between the winning and losing teams sometimes a losing team exemplifies a high standard of teamwork and efficiency I have seen losing teams sometimes appearing better organized than the winning team We Americans are so often obsessed with winning and losing that we often overlook excellence
0	A Nightmare on Elm Street The Dream ChildThis is a bad movie There s no escaping it I love the series and I think Freddy is probably the best character ever in horror movies But even being a fan I can t help but see this movie is mediocre There s not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters By now they had just given up They don t even try They are the production of course hoping for a few more easy dollars The story doesn t grab your attention Its so simple it s almost absent Alice a survivor from part is now pregnant Freddy is coming back through the baby s dreams At the beginning we learn that to stop him Alice must find his mother And that s it The story advances slowly since there s so little plot meaning it turns pretty boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and awful acting In fact that s the only scary thing the acting since the deaths are not even slightly cool The characters are so uninteresting we couldn t care less for them The girls are as unattractive as possible The whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theatre group I ve seen better actors in school plays It s embarrassing really Lisa Wilcox still manages to bring some class to this She is beautiful sexy and has some talent But the material just didn t let her shine What a pity Stephen Hopkins work is nowhere close to Renny Harlin s brilliant direction in Dream Master He tries some imaginative shots near the end but that tension Harlin and Craven created so well in the previous movies is no where to be found The Dream Child is just another unimaginative sequel It s the kind of movie that give horror series a bad name The end for the once scary Freddy It s too sad to see him now A clown that s not funny A bad joke Goodbye Freddy
0	Poorly made blaxploitation crime drama aimed squarely at the black urban market of the early s Pam Grier stars in the title role that of a nurse who becomes a one woman vigilante after drug dealing thugs make Coffy s little sister a junkie Violent nonsense plods along doggedly with canned energy and excitement only Grier s flaring temper gives the narrative a jolt she s not much of an actress here but she connects with the audience in a primal way Not much different from what Charles Bronson was doing at this time the film was marketed and advertised as crass exploitation yet still managed to find a sizable inner city audience Today however it s merely a footnote in s film history and lacks the wide range appeal of other movies in this genre from
0	I saw this film on the History Channel today in First of all I realize that this is not a documentary that it is a drama But one might hope that at least the critical facts that the story turns on might be based on actual events Reagan was shot and the other characters were real people The movie got that right From there on reliance on facts rapidly decays I had never heard of this movie before seeing it Having been a TV reporter at the time of these events I was stunned that I had never heard anything about the bizarre behavior of Secretary Haig as portrayed by Richard Dreyfuss The whole nation had heard the I am in control etc but Dreufuss Haig is bullying a cowered cabinet and totally out of control personally Having watched the film I began researching the subject on the Internet and quickly found actual audio tapes and transcripts of most of the Situation Room conversations that this film pretends to reenact Incredibly many the the principal facts of the film meant to show a White House Secret Service etc in total chaos and the nation s leadership behaving irrationally and driving the world near the brink of nuclear war are demonstrably incorrect They didn t happen There is internal conflict to be sure Haig makes missteps his press room performance is historically regrettable and he is difficult But there is nothing approaching the scenes depicted in the film There are too many gross errors to list but any fair comparison of the recorded and written record and the fantasy of this film begs the question as to what the producers were really trying to accomplish Enlighten Inform Entertain I believe they failed on all three fronts It is difficult to ascribe motives to others but one must seriously question what was behind such shameless invention And as for my beloved History Channel s Reel to Real follow on documentary there was almost no mention of the issues that were the central focus of the film namely the events within the Administration on the day of the shooting So the viewer was left to research those without much if any help from the network
0	note to George Litman and others the Mystery Science Theater riff is I don t think so breeder my favorite riff is Why were you looking at his like simply for the complete absurdity that and Right well did not over all I would say we must give credit to the MST K crew for trying to ridicule this TV movie you really can t make much fun of the dialog Bill S was a good playwright on the other hand this production is so bad that even he would disown it a junior high school drama club could do better I would recommend that you buy a book and read Hamlet
1	I have to say Seventeen Missing is much better than I expected The perception I took from the previews was that it would be just humdrum but I was pleasantly surprised with this impressive mystery Dedee Pfeiffer is Emilie a mom who insists her daughter Lori Tegan Moss not attend a so called graduation party one weeknight but Lori ignores her mother s wishes and takes off for the party anyway When Lori does not come home Emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance Seventeen Missing is better than so many other TV movies of this type as it is not so predictable Pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie and most of it comes off as believable This LMN Original Movie premiered last night
0	I was very excited about this film when I first saw the previews Normally I see a preview this good and I buy the film outright Something told me to you know watch it first I m glad I did Keira Knightley ruined all future films for me with this role In the nd Pirates movie when it came out I went to see it All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated her more for it I think that had to do with her hair and having to cut it short for Domino Domino who Who is Domino Harvey I still don t really know or care I don t know who she was in real life or who she was in this film I didn t care about her character and even Keira getting partically naked didn t make it worth the movie The direction was definitely lacking The writing was trite and shallow The editing was horrible I don t mind the style so much as the poor overuse of it There s a place for it Good examples of choppy MTV style colorful editing not sure if there s an official name would be Fight Club just off the top of my head Even Enemy of the State had a semi similar editing style at parts It was used tastefully and wasn t used as a crutch I mean this is the same guy who directed Top Gun and Crimson Tide Tony Scott please give me my time back I understand there are many people who liked this movie I guess the idea that you ll either completely love this movie or completely hate it is a fair assessment Frankly I hate it
0	This film is a portrait of the half spastic teenage boy Benjamin who has to visit a boarding school because of his lousy marks in Math He didn t make the best experiences in life before and got serious self esteem issues After a rough start at his new school he starts making friends falls in love with a girl and does some American Pieish teenage stuff Beside some comedy elements the film is told in a very serious way focussing on Benjamin and his problems If you already don t like this story outline save your time and watch something else If you do please be aware of the following Benjamin is a total loser Whatever he does he does it terribly wrong and then he goes for self pity all the time For me he wasn t that kind of charming loser who you can feel sympathy for and laugh with Instead he and his behavior really annoyed me and with my own teenage years not so far behind I could barely stand watching The film hardly tries to be realistic and the story seems to be but from my experience the characters just aren t except for Janosch maybe And yes I know this film is based on an auto biography written by a year old but having some experiences with German schools and German youth myself I don t believe him Showing the sexual awakening really is an important thing for a film with this subject But I doubt that teenage boys do an Ejaculate on the cookie contest where everyone has to hit a cookie with his sperm during mass masturbation in the woods and the loser has to eat the sperm wet cookie afterwards Although it kinda amused me in a contemptible way it s nor funny neither underlining the serious attempts of this film There s a sub plot about Benjamin s family and his father betraying his wife still I don t know why it s there and where to put it It just bored me Well I personally hated this film for having the character of Benjamin being without a message concept scheme whatever and it s failing attempts to be dramatic and serious However I can image that some people may find it sensible and touching If you liked The Other Sister you ll probably like this one too I hated both year old boys shouldn t write an autobiography and if they do it doesn t seem to be the best idea to make a film out of it out of
1	In Paris the shy and insecure bureaucrat Trelkovsky Roman Polanski rents an old apartment without bathroom where the previous tenant the Egyptologist Simone Choule Dominique Poulange committed suicide The unfriendly concierge Shelley Winters and the tough landlord Mr Zy Melvyn Douglas establish stringent rules of behavior and Trekovsky feels ridden by his neighbors Meanwhile he visits Simone in the hospital and befriends her girlfriend Stella Isabelle Adjani After the death of Simone Trekovsky feels obsessed for her and believes his landlord and neighbors are plotting a scheme to force him to also commit suicide The weird Le Locataire is a disturbing and creepy tale of paranoia and delusion The story and the process of madness and loss of identity of the lonely Trelkovsky are slowly developed in a nightmarish atmosphere in the gruesome location of his apartment and what is happening indeed is totally unpredictable The performances are awesome and Isabelle Adjani is extremely beautiful My vote is eight Title Brazil O Inquilino The Tenant
1	Pick Up never got the respect it should have It works on many levels and has a complicated but followable plot The actors involved give some of their finest performances Ann Margret Roy Scheider and John Glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals Notable too are Vanity who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows and Kelly Preston who s character will haunt you for a few days Anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this
1	I love this movie My friend Marcus and I were browsing the local Hastings because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled across this fine film We had no idea what it was going to be about but it turned out spectacular thumbs up I liked how the film was shot and the actors were very funny If you are are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think I highly suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie I would tell you some of my favorite parts but that might ruin the film for you so I won t This movie is definitely on my top list of good movies Do you really think Nothing is bouncy
1	MY LEFT FOOT in my opinion is a great biopic about one of the world s most talented authors and painters The performances were smashing the soundtrack was great and the casting was perfect I thought that Christy Daniel Day Lewis was a very talented man although I couldn t understand what he was saying most of the time In addition when he threw a tantrum I got a little scared Also it s just so sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy In conclusion if you are a die hard fan of Daniel Day Lewis or like biopics I highly recommend this great biopic about one of the world s most talented authors and painters You re in for a real treat and a good time so don t miss this one
0	This film is a joke and Quinton should be ashamed of himself trying to pass this off as a Modesty Blaise Film If you are having trouble sleeping then all means rent this film The stick figure they call a actress who is suppose to be Modesty Blaise has got to be the most boring person on this planet Maybe she could be used as a hat stand in the back ground of a real film seventy five minutes of nothing thank you who ever invented the fast forward button If you see this film if you can call it that coming your way RUN I can t help but think what rd world country could of used the money wasted of this crap this film is boring the actors are boring waste of colour a waste air they breath If you would like to see Mostey Blaise Film then watch the one they made in the s maybe that what the director should of done
0	Not even the most ardent stooge fan could possibly like the movie I one of them the stooges just aren t given any material to work with It is really a shame too because this is the only feature length movie the stooges did with Curly and this one effort by them is painfully unfunny when it could have had great potential Awful musical numbers don t help any either The short they did with the same title has more laughs
1	With stunning cinematography and a thread of Kafkaesque absurdity this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene The movie plays much like a dream and I think that may be why people either hate it or love it Characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless But these are failings of the movie but conscious choices The film works isn t trying to work as history but rather is a deconstruction of s war movies I would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that I was completely swept away This is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever and there is a wild imagination in its style I can completely understand why people would hate it but I give it

1	a timeless classic wonderfully acted with perfect location settings conjuring a marvelous atmospheric movie a simple story mingled with humor and suspense i wish that a video was available in Britain i have seen this film on many occasions and it remains one of my favorites along with Oh Mr Porter
1	This is a great movie I did the play a while ago It had an extra zing to it I loved Vanessa Williams as Rosey and also Jason Alexander has a good voice It was great The setting were also very good Except the fact that it is hours and minutes makes it pretty long Overall I give it stars They also added a few parts but it was still cool
0	This isn t the worst movie I ve ever seen but I really can t recall when I ve seen a worse one I thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation What it really was is a soap opera and a bad one at that They overplayed the conflict card to the extreme The first hour or so seems like a shouting match with some implausible scenes thrown in Possible spoiler The or so minute memorial scene with requisite black umbrellas and rain to fictitious crash victims was lame and I thought it would never end Avoid this one at all costs unless you revel in conflict
0	Really bad movie the story is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a complement This vampire s hunter story is the worst that i have seen so far Derek Bliss Jon Bon Jovi travels to Mexico in search for some blood suckers he use some interesting weapons but nothing compared to Blade and is part of some Van Helsig vampire s hunters net OK but he work alone He s assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight is almost a sequel of Vampires directed by John Carpenter and starred by James Woods Derek start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends Sancho Diego Luna really bad acting also a teenager without experience Father Rodrigo Cristian De la Fuente a catholic priest Zoey Natasha Wagner a particular vampire and Ray Collins Darius McCrary another expert vampire hunter So obviously in this adventure he isn t alone You can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his lead actor Jon Bon Jovi is a huge difference in the acting quality compared to James Woods and then if you watch the film i don t recommend this part you will get involved in one of the more simplest stories totally predictable with terrible acting performances really bad special effects and incoherent events I deeply recommend not to see this film rent another movie see another channel go out with your friends etc
1	I agree with Jerry It s a very underrated space movie of course how many good low budget ones AREN T underrated If I remember correctly the solution to the mystery was a sort of variation but not rip off of because the computer controlling the spaceship had actually been a man who had somehow been turned into a computer And like HAL they tried to disconnect his mind but not the mechanical parts of him and as with HAL it led to disaster There is at least one funny moment When the Christopher Cary character who can t find any food finds the abandoned pet bird there s a kind of ominous moment but then the obvious thing doesn t happen after all
1	Escaping the life of being pimped by her father and the speakeasy waitressing who dies in an explosion Lily Powers Barbara Stanwyck who is simply ravishing sluts her way through the branches inside a bank business in big city Gotham When a possessive lover murders who was supposed to be his next father in law and Lily s new lover the sky s the limit for Lily as she has written down her various relationships in a diary and subtlety makes it known the papers will receive it if certain pay doesn t come into her hands Newly appointed president to the bank Courtland Trenholm George Brent sends Lily to Paris instead of forking over lots of dough but soon finds himself madly in love after various encounters with her in the City of Love This makes Lily s mouth water as now she ll have reached the pedestal of success seducing a man of wealth and prestige bring riches her way Though circumstances ensue which will bring her to make a decision that threatens her successful way of achieving those riches Trenholm now her husband is being indicted with jail certain and has lost the bank He needs money Lily now has in her possession or he ll have absolutely nothing Stanwyck is the whole movie despite that usual Warner Brothers polish Being set in the pre code era gives the filmmakers the chance to elaborate on taboo subjects such as a woman using sex to achieve success and how that can lead to tragedy Good direction from Alfred E Green shows through subtlety hints in different mannerisms and speech through good acting from the seductive performance of Stanwyck how to stage something without actually showing the explicit act Obviously the film shows that money isn t everything and all that jazz as love comes into the heart of Lily s dead heart That ending having Lily achieve the miraculous metamorphosis into someone in love didn t ring true to me She s spent all this time to get to that platform only to fall for a man who was essentially no different than others she had used before him
0	I really wanted to like this film but the story is ridicules I don t want to spoil this film don t worry right from the begin you know something bad is going to happen but here s an example of how sloppy this film was put together The Cowboy and Twig ride up the ridge The Cowboy has a handle bar mustache The Cowboy and Twig get into a shoot out and race half way down the ridge The Cowboy is clean shaven through out the rest of the film Sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to shave in dark on the back of a horse To be fair the acting by the four main characters is solid
1	I will never forget when I saw this title in the video store way back when I was always a big Weird Al fan and when I saw this video I rented and watched it I was too young to appreciate all of Al s subtle humor and satire at the time but I remember it much later when I was old enough to understand what I was watching If you are an Al fan especially of his earlier work you will thoroughly enjoy this film It is done in the MTV esque Rockumentary style and tells a true but sometimes exaggerated tale of how Al got to be where he was in You will love it if you like his brand of humor and more importantly his music
0	Watching this film for the action is rather a waste of time because the figureheads on the ships act better than the humans It s a mercy that Anthony Quinn couldn t persuade anyone else to let him direct any other films after this turkey But it is filled with amusement value since Yul Brynner has hair Lorne Greene displays an unconvincing French accent and the rest of the big names strut about in comic book fashion
0	This was the worst acted movie I ve ever seen in my life No really I m not kidding All the based on a true story historical references aside there s no excuse for such bad acting It s a shame because as others have posted the sets costumes were great The sound track was typical asian style music although I couldn t figure out where the modern love song came in when Fernando was lying in his bed thinking of Maria I don t know who wrote sang that beautiful song but it was as if suddenly Norah Jones was transported to the s The Hershey syrup blood in Phycho was more realistic than the ketchup spurted during the Kwik n EZ battle scenes But the acting Oh so painfully sad Lines delivered like a bad junior high play If Gary Stretch had donned a potato costume for the County H Fair he may have been more believable Towards the end he sounded more like a Little Italy street thug At times I half expected him to yell out Adrian or even You wanna piece of me Favourite line When the queen says to her lover after barfing on the floor I m going to have a baby He responds A child I expected her to retort No jackass a chair leg Duh
0	Five Across the Eyes starts as five young teenage girls are driving home in time for their curfew they stop off at a store accidentally hit another car decide to just drive off leave it Soon after the other car forces them to stop a crazy woman with a shotgun gets out shouts at them makes them take their clothes off makes them pee on them then randomly drives off Shaken shocked the girls think their ordeal is over but the crazy woman comes back for seconds as she seems intent on killing the terrified girls who are lost are low on gas Produced directed by Greg Swinson Ryan Theissen with Swinson writing the thing Theissen responsible for the cinematography editing I have to say that Five Across the Eyes is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen if not the worst I mean I m struggling to think of a film I have seen that s worse Now let me start off by saying that I am sure a lot of the film making decision taken here were deliberate to try provoke atmosphere tension realism suspense but there is not one aspect of Five Across the Eyes that I didn t hate it to be honest it looks like a bad home video that has been put up on YouTube even then it s still slightly embarrassing a frankly worthless waste of odd minutes of my time that I could have been doing something more entertaining fun like pulling my fingernails out with pliers The reviews on the web seem quite positive but on the IMDb the amount of Star comments is revealing they can t all be wrong right it s message board which I think is much more of an indicator of what the average person thinks it s absolutely trashed by just about everyone the phrase the worst film I have ever seen is used a few times to be fair most of these negative comments mention th same things I have to agree with them The story is terrible alright I suspect it s meant to be minimalistic but this minimal There s never any reason or explanation for the events that happen it just feels totally random It goes on for ages the amount of plot here would struggle to fill a thirty minute made for telly program let along a full length feature The dialogue is awful with these annoying girls who don t seem to have a brain cell between them taking about random stuff screaming a lot Oh god the screaming there are seemingly endless scenes of these girls screaming or crying or whining which not only irritates annoys prevents any sane viewer feeling any sort of sympathy for them it also makes what they are trying to say almost impossible to hear properly Then there s the real killer the entire film is set shot within the confines of a mini van seriously the camera never leaves this car as you can imagine it gets really boring add that the low body count of just one person killed on screen Five Across the Eyes is a film that I hated with a passion On a technical level again I can see that the film making style here was a deliberate choice but I have to be honest again say Five Across the Eyes is the worst looking film I have ever seen As a fan of film I like my films to look like proper films as it s a visual medium I definitely don t want them to look worse than the average YouTube video or my home films shot on a camcorder while I was drunk It really does look that amateurish that bad it s a complete eyesore I hated every moment of every second of it Just think The Blair Witch Project only ten times worse looking sounding you will be almost there There are times during Five Across the Eyes when you literally can t tell what s going on or happening because of the camera work the almost pitch black grainy contrast levels The violence is tame too with a few splashes of blood a stabbing at the end Low budget doesn t even begin to describe Five Across the Eyes with a supposed budget of about this is easily one of the lowest budgeted films ever given a wide release The two vans in the film were owned by members of the production that s basically pretty much the entire budget right there the locations The acting is pretty bad by the main cast I just hated all the fake put on crying screaming that didn t convince at all but did irritate immensely Five Across the Eyes will go down as one of the worst films I have ever seen I have seen a few films whenever anyone now ask s me what s the worst film I have ever seen Five Across the Eyes will definitely get a mention I hated it every single aspect wretched moment of it
0	I wasn t terribly impressed with Dante s st season offering in Homecoming it wasn t much of a horror story but rather a smart political statement with the undead Screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes men s sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women The episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists Then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home I assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak but is unclear because this is never revisited The episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blah It seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end The worst episode Well except for chocolate
1	We first watched this film as part of a festival of new Argentine films in at the Walter Reade Although we liked it we didn t think it was extraordinary Watching it for a second time we found a different meaning in this look at life in Buenos Aires The film takes place in one of the darkest days of Argentina as the DeLaRua administration was ending The country was in turmoil after the economy which had flourished earlier in the s under the artificially climate President Menen created It was a time when bank accounts in dollars were frozen and people got themselves living a nightmare The story begins just as Santamarina a bank employee is fired because the collapse of the economy Instead of receiving sympathy from his wife she locks him out of the apartment and he for all practical purposes becomes a homeless man He takes to the streets trying to make ends meet The other story introduces us to Ariel a young Jew interviewing for a job in a Spanish company It s almost a miracle he gets the job His father Simon owns a small restaurant in the Jewish quarter of El Once in the center of the city Things go from bad to worse when Ariel s mother dies suddenly Only Estela the young woman who is in love with Ariel comes to help father and son Santamarina who is a clean man has to resort to take showers wherever he can He chooses a ladies room in one of the subway stations When the attendant Elsa finds him naked she becomes furious but she comes to her senses when she realizes the unhappy circumstances of this man who has seen better times They become romantically involved and Santamarina in one of his trips through the street garbage finds an infant Elsa while surprised wants to do the right thing But Santamarina convinces her of the meaning of an innocent life in their lives will cement their love Ariel who has met the gorgeous Laura at work begins a turbulent and heavy sexual affair with his beautiful co worker who unknown to him is involved in a lesbian affair Ariel who free lances by photographing weddings and other occasions feels a passion for Laura but he realizes what Estela has sacrificed in order to help his father and still loves him Daniel Burman whose El Abrazo Partido we thought was excellent did wonders with this film Things are put in its proper perspective after a second viewing recently and we must apologize for not having perceived it the first time around If anything this second time the nuances of the screen play Mr Burman and Emiliano Torres wrote make more sense because they reflect the turmoil of what the country was living during those dark days Daniel Hendler who plays Ariel has collaborated with Mr Burman before to surprising results He is not movie star pretty yet he is handsome This actor projects a tremendous sincerity in his work Enrique Pineyro is another magnificent surprise His Santamarina is disarming In spite of all the bad things that have fallen on him he keeps a rosy attitude toward everyone he meets Stefania Sandrelli the interesting Italian actress makes a great contribution to the film with her Elsa Hector Alterio one of the best Argentine actors plays the small part of Simon The gorgeous Chiara Coselli is seen as Laura and Melina Petrielli appears as the noble Estela Esperando al mesias proves Daniel Burman is a voice to be reckoned with in the Argentine cinema
0	I almost made a fool of myself when I was going to start this review by saying This movie reminded me of BILLY ELLIOT but then I looked up the resume of screenwriter Lee Hall only to find out that he was the guy who wrote BILLY ELLIOT so it s Mr Hall who s making a fool of himself not me Am I being a bit cruel on him No because Lee has something most other aspiring screenwriters from Britain don t have He has his foot in the door he has previously written a successful British movie that won awards and made money at the box office and what does he do next He gives the audience more of the same Young Jimmy Spud lives on some kitchen sink estate He is bullied at school and no one loves him The only thing keeping him going is that he has aspirations to be a ballet dancer No actually he has aspirations to be an angel but considering his household he may as well be a ballet dancer He has a macho waster of a father who thinks Ballet dancers are a bunch of poofs while his granddad says Ballet dancers are as tough as any man you could meet I remember seeing the Bolshoi ballet Yup Ballet is a main talking point on a run down British council estate those days NOT Come to think of it neither is left wing politics which seems to be the sole preserve of middle class do gooders who live in nice big houses so right away everything about this set up feels ridiculously false Another major criticism is that this is a film that has no clue who it s trying to appeal to I have often criticised Channel for broadcasting movies at totally inappropriate times THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT at am for example but they showed this at am and for once they ve got it spot on Considering the story involves politics ballet dancing Gawd I hate it lung cancer and poverty there s no way this can be deemed suitable for a family audience but since the main protagonist is an year old child and features angels and ballet dancers Don t blame me if I seem obsessed with the subject there was no need to refer to them there s not much here for an intelligent adult audience either Of course if Lee Hall had been told at the script development stage by the producers that he should write a story featuring a schoolboy and an angel and had flatly refused saying that he wanted to write about other themes and stories then I will apologise but throughout the movie you do get the feeling that once the film was completed it was going to be marketed to the exact same audience who enjoyed BILLY ELLIOT
1	Every now and then a movie advertises itself as scary or frightening though they usually aren t Most modern horror movies fit into this category Then there are those movies that don t simply cause the tension and adrenaline to pump through your veins harder than usual They actually frighten you to a level that you ve never experienced Halloween is such a film It takes so many risks that would make most movie producers cringe But nearly all of them work Halloween is awe inspiring in its simplicity and terrifying as a whole The story is simple Laurie Strode Jamie Lee Curtis is babysitting some kids on Halloween night while a madman is on the loose after escaping from a mental institution after brutally murdering his older sister years ago Of course the madman later known as Michael Myers begins killing the local teenage population and eventually he comes after Laurie Sounds familiar right Just another brainless slasher filled with dumb teenagers and gobs of gore Not a chance I think James Berardinelli puts it perfectly in his review of Halloween Because of its title Halloween has frequently been grouped together with all the other splatter films that populated theaters throughout the late s and early s However while Halloween is rightfully considered the father of the modern slasher genre it is not a member He has a point and for a number of reasons First and foremost it s downright terrifying whereas most entries into the teen slasher genre are dumb gore fests one could argue that many recent ones are tongue in cheek but most of those fail as well Second there is almost no violence very little of which is bloody John Carpenter knows that violence does not equal scary and he relies very little on it actually the body count is pretty low In fact one can argue that this isn t really a horror movie at least not by todays standards of having the most deaths that can be crammed into a single movie each gorier and more sadistic than the last He relies on ideas for scares and also skill Third while some of the characters may do stupid things that sometimes seal their fate they don t do them because they re dumb The characters are real people so instead of thinking that the characters die because they re idiots we re frightened because they re making a mistake One of the main reasons why Halloween is so scary is because it is so easy to believe that it s real Nothing is hard to swallow in this film There s no supernatural there s no ridiculously creative plot elements or inventive murders or whatnot Instead all the set pieces and camera work save the opening sequence are simple Carpenter just sets the camera in place and says action What we get is the feeling that we re actually seeing a murder take place right in front of us Horror movies are probably the most difficult films to make because in order for something to be scary everything has to be perfect and ideas never work twice It s a hit or miss game which is why if I were to tell you all the good ideas that Carpenter has which I m not they d seem primitive particularly since they have been repeated with lesser effect over and over again through the years Acting here is not a plus point because it doesn t need to be This is a movie about scary ideas not a movie about dramatic conflicted characters The actors act like real people not characters from a story Nothing more The exception to this is whoever plays The Shape or later known as Michael Myers It can be scary to have a person say nothing and simply kill but it s hard to pull off and even harder to keep people from asking why But the guy pulls it off and the result is terrifying This is Carpenter s movie through and through He directed it co wrote it co produced it and wrote the chilling score of it This is a man of brilliance and his later movie The Thing supports this statement though The Thing is not as scary as Halloween Unfortunately his success has dramatically diminished as it happens when the lure of big money for less freedom is taken advantage of once big time producers recognize your potential As good as this film is it s not without flaws The famous opening scene is disturbing but not very scary And not many of the scares work for the first part of the movie It s not that it s bad it s just that there s no good reason to fear The Shape Luckily Carpenter mostly uses this time to set up a relationship between the characters and the audience While there s no intimacy in this relationship it fits the purpose We grow to know the characters but not so much that it s disheartening when they die But once the film gets to Halloween night that s when Carpenter kicks things into high gear and it NEVER stops until you get to the end While Halloween may be flawed it is only slightly so It is an immensely terrifying film and a must see for anyone who loves scary movies Be warned though this movie will scare the living hell out of you
0	Horrible waste of time bad acting plot directing This is the most boring movie EVER There are bad movies that are fun Freddy vs Jason and there are bad movies that are HORRIBLE This one fits into the latter Bottom Line don t waste your time
1	This is an above average Jackie Chan flick due to the fantastic finale and great humor however other then that it s nothing special All the characters are pretty cool and the film is entertaining throughout plus Jackie Chan is simply amazing in this Jackie and Wai Man Chan had fantastic chemistry together and are both very funny and i thought the main opponent looked really menacing however the dubbing was simply terrible The character development is above average for this sort of thing and the main fight is simply fantastic plus some of the bumps Jackie takes in this one are harsh There is a lot of really silly and goofy humor in this but it amused me and the ending is hilarious plus all the characters are quite likable It s pretty cheap looking but generally very well made and while it does not have the amount of fighting you would expect from a Jackie Chan flick it does enough to keep you watching plus one of my favorite moments in this film is when Jackie Dragon and Wai Man Chan Tiger are playing around with a rifle and it goes off This is an above average Jackie Chan flick due to the fantastic finale and great humor however other then that it s nothing great still it s well worth the watch The Direction is good Jackie Chan does a good job here with solid camera work fantastic angles and keeping the film at a fast pace for the most part The Acting is very good Jackie Chan is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable hilarious as usual does some crazy stunts had fantastic chemistry with Wai Man Chan kicked that ass and played this wonderful cocky character he was amazing i just wished they would stop dubbing him Jackie Rules Wai Man Chan is funny as Jackie s best friend i really liked him he is also a very good martial artist Rest of the cast do OK i guess Overall well worth the watch out of
0	As a cinema fan White Noise was an utter disappointment as a filmmaker the cinematography was pretty good nicely lit good camera work reasonable direction But as a film it just seamed as predictable as all the other so called horror movies that the market has recently been flooded with Although it did have a little bit of the chill factor the whole concept of the E V O Electronic Voice Phenomena did not seem believable This movie did not explain the reasonings for certain occurrences but went ahead with them The acting was far from mind blowing the main character portrayed no emotion like many recent thriller horror movies Definitely not a movie I will be buying on DVD and would not recommend anyone rushes out to see it
1	The Days is a typical family drama with a little catch you must relate to the character s emotions in every way possible in order for you to truly appreciate the show Possible Spoilers For Those Who Are Unfamiliar With the Show The story obviously for all the people who has watched the show is the world of Cooper Day the middle child of the family He records his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day because of his observations His family includes a mother a father a perfect sister and a genius little brother The first episode which is going to sound a bit stupid since John Scott Shepard has created this situation both the sister and mother gets pregnant That s the first situation the writer hits Then the father quits his job at the law firm The youngest son gets a panic attack The middle child gets in a fight with the sister s boyfriend This is all in a day s work Spoilers I admire this show I don t know It s a bit crappy but I like it First I thought the camera work was a ripoff but then I got used it and started to like it I liked the quiet conversations under a dark light I liked the intimate feeling of the show I liked the low budget style I liked the acting I admire the story Then I find myself wanting a second season of The Days I slowly became a fan of it as the episode airing on ABC came to an end It s a really good show and it s nothing like The OC The two have nothing in common So I hope fans will stop comparing them And if you can relate to either Abby Jack Natalie Cooper or even Nate you ll like this show A lot
1	The title got my attention and then I wondered what will come out in the plot as we have seen so many super people movies these years and in fact I really liked it as there were a number of unusual funny scenes that I didn t expect Uma Thurman performed as average in G Girl s role Surprisingly I was again able to watch her toes in wide screen like in the beginning of Kill Bill Luke Wilson however played very well the idiot everyday guy who meets the big woman I could really get into his situation If you want a light touch of fun you should definitely watch G Girl s and average Matt s adventures especially to cheer up your partner in my collection
1	I find it very intriguing that Lee Radziwill Jackie Kennedy s sister and the cousin of these women would encourage the Maysles to make Big Edie and Little Edie the subject of a film They certainly could be considered the skeletons in the family closet The extra features on the DVD include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women I d say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating i e Are they nuts Or am I missing something This movie is hard to come by Netflix does not have it Facets does though
1	I saw this movie in the first couple of weeks it was out I don t remember exactly when I thought that it was alright for a Ben Stiller movie This movie isn t for a person without a good sense of humor Like most of Ben Stiller s jokes you have to think about them Or like I said you have a good sense of humor From a couple of people on this website I saw that people didn t have anything good to say about it and It didn t get a very good rating But I would have given it a larger one This movie I thought was very good and it should have gotten a better rating Maybe this isn t a movie for you I m just giving you another person s opinion
1	Joan Fontaine stars as the villain in this Victorian era film She convincingly plays the married woman who has a lover on the side and also sets her sights on a wealthy man Miles Rushworth who is played by Herbert Marshall Mr Marshall is quite good as Miles Miss Fontaine acted her part to perfection she was at the same time cunning calculating innocent looking frightened and charming It takes an actress with extraordinary talent to pull that off Joan Fontaine looked absolutely gorgeous in the elegant costumes by Travis Banton Also in the film is Joan s mother Lillian Fontaine as Lady Flora I highly recommend this film
0	The Wicker Man I am so angry that I cannot write a proper comment about this movie The plot was ridiculous thinly tied together and altogether just lame Nicolas Cage shame on you I assumed that since you were in it that it would be at least decent It was not I felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor and even if it s complete the movie was just outlandish and silly At the end you re left mouth agape mind befuddled and good taste offended I have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred People were complaining about it in small groups in the mall four floors down from the theater near the entrance It s that bad I heard it compared to Glitter American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli My boyfriend was so mad he wouldn t even talk about it Grrrr
1	This is a most handsome film The color photography is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of the Metropolitan Opera House in brilliant color Other indoor scenes at various mansions etc are equally brilliant As for the music what more can be said other than that Lanza s voice was at its peak as he sang so many of the worlds best known and beloved arias The marvelous Dorothy Kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of Lanza in delightful harmony Of course Hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of Caruso There is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events For example the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth There are some very good web sites that tell the true story of Caruso and contain several pictures of him These web sites can be located by using any good search engine There are also several books available concerning his life history But the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film The voices of Lanza Kirsten and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie Enjoy I know that I sure did
1	My father was the warden of the prison he is retired now showcased in this documentary and I ve grown up around the prison life so perhaps my views will be totally different from everyone else who watches this movie I will say this the filmmakers who brought us this minute miracle are fantastic artists and even better people They were brave enough to A Show up and tell this story B Get inside these inmates minds and hearts and C Do all of this responsibly Responsible to their art and more importantly responsible to the inmates and staff of Luther Luckett Correctional Complex They should be commended without end for this work To take hours yes HOURS of footage and be able to cut and whittle it down to riveting minutes is nothing short of extraordinary and they have my utmost respect I saw this film under circumstances that only a very very few were able to see it I was at the inmate screening I was in the same room with these men as they watched their hearts being poured out on screen I saw men crying on television crying in the chair in front of me and let me tell you it was a very profound experience These men have committed horrendous crimes in some cases yet have found ways to try to redeem themselves even if they view themselves as unredeemable How many of us have the courage to do this How many people could do what they have done in such a harsh environment To see them react to the film was an experience I am eternally grateful for and I will never forget that I thank the men who allowed me this glimpse into their lives I thank my father for making ALL of this possible and I thank Philomath Films for taking the time to pour their blood sweat soul and tears into this project This movie will change everything you think you know about prison life and the inmates held within it Oz is not real television is not real Shakespeare Behind Bars is
0	I thought Harvey Keitel a young fresh from the Sex Pistols John Lydon then as a bonus the music by Ennio Morricone I expected an old school edgy Italian cop thriller that was made in America Istead I got a mishmash story that never made sense and a movie that left me saying WTF Too many unanswered questions and not enough action The result a potential cult classic got flushed down the toilet Keitel and Lydon work well together so maybe Quentin Tarantino can reunite these guys with better script Oh and the Morricone score OK but not memorable Overall not a waste of time but not a must see unless you are a hardcore Keitel fan
1	Like his elder brothers Claude Sautet and Jean Pierre Melville Alain Corneau began to cut his teeth in French cinema with a series of fine thrillers la Menace and S rie Noire among others Police Python is a good example of how Corneau conceived and shot his works at this time of his career They had a splendid cinematography painstaking screenplays and a sophisticated directing elaborated for efficiency s sake The police superintendent Ferrot Yves Montand is a cop with unconventional methods who usually works all alone He makes the acquaintance of a young woman Sylvia L opardi Stefania Sandrelli and becomes her lover while ignoring that she has another lover his superior Ganay Fran ois P rier When the latter learns it he kills her in a fit of anger Ferrot has to investigate the murder and all the clues are inexorably against him One could deem that this kind of far fetched story isn t exempt from glitches and sometimes one can see right through it but Corneau s pedantic directorial style helps to conjure up a stifling dusky atmosphere The first part of the film before the night of the murder might seem uninteresting and however it is crucial for what will follow this key moment Corneau falls back on a sober treatment with rather sparse moments and short appearances by secondary minor characters whom the viewer will see again during the investigation In spite of drawbacks Corneau and his scenarist Daniel Boulanger penned a deft story M nard Mathieu Carri re who sometimes expresses his surprise because Ferrot keeps a relatively low profile during the investigation But his superior knows that he usually works alone Actually Ferrot has to find solid tricks to muddy the waters and so to exonerate himself Eventually the chief idea of the film concerns Ferrot himself He s a cop who bit by bit loses his identity and finds himself in the heart of a terrible depersonalization It is epitomized by the moment when he throws himself acid on his face so that witnesses won t recognize him when he is brought face to face with them The backdrop of this thriller Orl ans is efficiently enhanced by Corneau s camera and helps to inspire this eerie thriller its pernicious charm
0	The premise sucked me in but it was clear about seconds in that this was either David Lynch or something seriously terrible Interesting to watch just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list I can be a sucker for a stirring spiritual piece Romero comes to mind but there was nothing spiritual whatsoever about this one The message seems to be that we must all pretend we have an iq of or simply get a lobotomy Jennifer what happened to ya and blindly follow the Bible without any sort of self examination whatsoever or we ll trigger the second coming It s the kind of attitude that makes people fly jumbo jets into story buildings I work around the corner from the site of the former WTC I like to think that God is a little greater than that
1	Being a transplanted New Yorker I might be more critical than most in watching City Hall But I have to say that before even getting to the story itself I was captivated by the location shooting and the political atmosphere of New York City that Director Harold Becker created For example there s a reference to Woerner s Restaurant in Brooklyn where political boss Frank Anselmo likes to eat There is or was a Woerner s Restaurant on Remsen Street in downtown Brooklyn when I lived in New York back in It was in fact particularly favored by political people in the Borough though they did have a couple of other hangouts No surprise because the script was co authored by Nicholas Pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories He knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this film A detective played by Nestor Serrano goes for an unofficial meeting with a relative of mob boss Anthony Franciosa and things erupt and three people wind up dead including an innocent year old boy whose father was walking him to school The story mushrooms and at the end it s reached inside City Hall itself Al Pacino plays Mayor John Pappas and John Cusack is his Deputy Mayor a transplanted Louisianan a state which has a tradition of genteel corruption itself He s the outsider here and in trying to do damage control Cusack finds more than he bargained for Danny Aiello plays Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo and for those of you not from New York his character is based on the late Borough President of Queens Donald Manes who was also brought down by scandal He s very much the kind of Brooklyn politician I knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them do Aiello in City Hall was the farewell performance on film for Anthony Franciosa one of the most underrated and under appreciated talents ever on the screen No one watches anyone else whenever he s on Al Pacino s best moment is when at the funeral of the young child killed he takes over the proceedings and turns it into a political triumph for himself His is a complex part he s a decent enough man but one caught up in the corruption it takes to rise in a place like New York For those who want to know about political life in the Big Apple City Hall is highly recommended
1	Deathtrap runs like a play within a movie about who did what to whom as it primarily takes place on one set The premise is that an accomplished playwright whose star is falling receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student and so he plans to off his protege and appropriate his play to the loud protests of his wife Or so you think for the first half of the movie Past the halfway mark Deathtrap begins to throw in twists and surprises that turn its premise on its head then right around and then in a mad spin all the time keeping its title appropriate It s an excellent mystery movie soaked in wit Michael Caine as the senior playwright plays himself in this movie a slightly loony and very dramatic Brit No surprises here he does his usual good work He gets the best line of Deathtrap which he executes perfectly What is your definition of success being gang banged in a state penitentiary Christopher Reeve on the other hand juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance playing the ambitious and psychopathic young playwright He also gets to show off his very toned body which he must ve retained coming off the Superman movies Caine and Reeve have collaborated in another movie that s one of my favorite comedies Noises Off It similarly revolves around a play as well although this time Caine is the director and Reeve is an actor They are joined by comic veterans Carol Burnett John Ritter Marilu Henner Taxi and Mark Linn Baker Perfect Strangers Together they demonstrate the calamities that befall the bed hopping cast and crew of a play On the surface the movie looks to be mostly slapstick but upon watching you find that they are many subtle jokes that require more than one viewing to catch Wish this underrated movie was available on DVD

1	I wasn t sure when I heard about this coming out I was thinking how dumb is Disney getting I was wrong I found it to be very good I mean it s not The Lion King but it s cool to see another side from a certain point It was very funny Also it wasn t one of those corny disney sequels were the animation sucks it was just like The Lion King animation The only thing that eritated me was the whole movie theater thing through out the movie Not to give anything way but you ll know what I am talking about I also fun that it was cool to have most of the cast from the original to return It was a very good movie over all
0	the Germans all stand out in the open and get mowed down with a machine gun the Good guys never die unless its for dramatic purposes the plot has so many holes its laughable Where did the German soldiers go once they rolled the fuel tank towards the train Erik Estrada Please And the whole idea hijacking a train How moronic is that The Germans KNOW where you are going to go its not like you can leave the track and drive away What a waste I would rather bonk myself on the head with a ball peen hammer times then have to sit through that again I mean seriously it FELT like it was made in the s but it was produced in the A Team is more believable than this horrid excuse for a movie Only watch it if you need a good laugh This movie is to Tele Sevalas what Green Beret was to John Wayne
1	I just watched this movie and have to say I was very impressed It s very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat I had to smoke several emergency cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves If I had to criticise I d say that perhaps if anything there were too many jump moments It got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect because you kind of new what was coming Although it contains virtually every clich in the ghost genre they were all done so well that it maintained the creepy fear factor It had elements of The Shining The th Sense and The Changeling in particular the soundtrack reminded me of The Changeling I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good old fashioned scare
0	WOW this movie was so horrible I m so glad i didn t have to pay money to see this horrible movie it was like a history nut went on a coke binge the previews of it made it look decent but it was REALLY bad i will say the idea sounded decent but come on it was really really bad If u sat down and thought about it you would also realize it was UNREALISTIC come on back in the day u think they had all that stuff to work with It wasn t like ben franklin sat down one day and made a damn riddle it was completely ridiculous and it you want to see a bad movie then by all means go see this one All and ALL HORRIBLE movie it might actually be on my top WORST films I ve ever seen
1	Coming from the same director who d done Candyman and Immortal Beloved I m not surprised it s a good film Ironically Papierhaus is a movie I d never heard of until now yet it must be one of the best movies of the late s partly because that is hands down the worst movie period in recent decades Not talking about Iranian or Swedish cinema here The acting is not brilliant but merely solid unlike what some people here claim they must have dreamt this wondrous acting much like Anna The story is an interesting fantasy that doesn t end in a clever way that ties all the loose ends together neatly These unanswered questions are probably left there on purpose leaving it up to the individual s interpretation and there s nothing wrong with that with a theme such as this Pepperhaus is a somewhat unusual mix of kids film and horror with effective use of sounds and music I like the fact that the central character is not your typical movie clich ultra shy but secretly brilliant social outcast girl but a regular normal kid very refreshing I am sick and tired of writers projecting their own misfit like childhoods into their books and onto the screens as if anyone cares anymore to watch or read about yet another miserly lonely childhood as if that s all there is or as if that kind of character background holds a monopoly on good potential The scene with Anna and the boy snogging for quite a stretch was a bit much evoking feelings of both vague disgust and amusement considering that she was supposed to be only but predictably it turned out that Burke was or when this was filmed I have no idea why they didn t upgrade the character s age or get a younger actress It was quite obvious that Burke isn t that young Why directors always cast kids older than what they play hence dilute the realism I ll never know
0	I ll tell you what happened some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best shows that was on TV Did we really need a big screen re make Did they ask the fans I wonder how all the fans would feel if they did a remake of Rocky Horror Picture Show with actors like Ashton Krutcher Steve Martin Britney Spears and Kiefer Southerland took out all the music and made it a drama Do you think they would like that This movie does not have the same feel to it that the original had Sure the original was a bit corny at times but Bo and Luke were always nice they got into trouble because they were always set up to get into trouble and their main objective was to help people that passed through town None of that mattered to the people that made this film they might have never even seen the original show all the way through My big question is what will they ruin next
1	JUST CAUSE is a flawed but decent film held together by strong performances and some creative though exceedingly predictable writing Sean Connery is an anti death penalty crusader brought in to save a seemingly innocent young black man Blair Underwood from the ultimate penalty To set things right Connery ventures to the scene of the crime where he must contend not only with the passage of time but a meddling sheriff Laurence Fishbourne Twists and turns and role reversals abound some surprising some not as the aging crusader attempts to unravel the mystery The climactic ending is a bit ludicrous but JUST CAUSE is worth a look on a slow night
0	I cannot believe this woodenly written and directed piece of cliche film got made There are about four good looking shots the director should think about switching to still photography and that s it A strong cast is utterly wasted scenes repeatedly end at the least interesting moments and the script says nothing new Please spare yourself this movie
0	As far as films go this is likable enough Entertaining characters good dialogue interesting enough story I would have really quite liked it had I not been irritated immensely whilst watching at the utter disrespect it shows the city it is set in Glasgow In Scotland Yet every character is English save for Sean s girlfriend who is Dutch Scottish accents are heard only fleetingly in menial jobs roles As a Scottish woman as a viewer who likes her real life films to be a bit more like real life I really don t think it would have hurt to use any one of the countless talented Scottish actors or at least got English ones who could toss together a decent accent The futile attempt at using the word wee a few times did nothing but to further the insult
0	I only rented this movie because of promises of William Dafoe and Robert Rodriguez I assumed that upon seeing RR s name on the cover as an actor that this movie would be good It sounds like a movie that Rodriguez would of made so if He s going to lend his name to it than it has to be good right WRONG WRONG WRONG By far the worst editing since Manos Hands of fate The way it was edited made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow and after the first minutes you wont even want to try to follow it anymore I have no idea how Dafoe and Rodriguez got involved in this film maybe they owed somebody but they are way to good for this Besides they were only in this movie for a couple minutes apiece and Rodriguez didn t even talk So if you wanna see a movie with Poor editing poor acting and confusing storyline than be my guest but don t say you weren t warned
1	E TV is a great channel and Talk Soup is so funny in a flash you can view the episodes change We want more funny writings by the best writer ever Stan Evans The patron Saint of the mindless masses He is a truly talented gifted writer actor comic producer director and creative consultant Anna Nicole loved him but he was not a Billionaire so he left him for a Billionaire Many super stars wanted to make films with the actor Stan Evans who has a Humphrey Bogart Clark Gable acting style He should make many more movies Maybe with Stephen Spielberg or perhaps many other talented producers We wish him a moment of FAME with a great fortune to gain Has he produced any mock U dramas or perhaps any docudrama A project about Bernie Madhoff would be a great TV movie written by STAN EVANS How many screenplays has he written Is he under billion contract with Disney He should earn more than Million He could also write a TV movie about the late KING OF POP Michael Jackson We want to view a lot more of and by Stan Evans in the movies and on TV Thank you so very much Elvis has left the building
1	It s always difficult to put a stamp on any film as being the best whether of all time a certain genre or what have you but I believe a strong argument could be made that in fact Laputa is the greatest animated film ever made It is in my mind the masterwork of Hayao Miyazaki the most talented of Japan s animated directors and it best captures his strengths as a director storyteller and designer as well as encapsulating all of his favorite underlying themes The version I m reviewing is the American dub I know sacrilege for a hard core anime fan to not watch it in its native language there is at least one other English language dub out there I have it on VHS I have no idea from what source and that version is the single best dub I have ever encountered of any film But I thought it better to concentrate on the version people can actually find Laputa tells the story of a boy named Pazu voiced by James Van Der Beek here who s growing up in a mining town when one day a young girl named Sheeta Anna Paquin literally drops from the sky It seems she is being pursued by a sinister government agent Colonel Muska Mark Hamill who is more interested in the magical crystal that hangs around her neck To keep things lively there s also a wickedly funny pirate gang after the crystal led by the aging but still boisterous Dola Cloris Leachman The plot revolves around the crystal s ability to reveal the location of the fabled flying city of Laputa a potential treasure trove of scientific knowledge and hidden treasure It s all very much in keeping with a fairy tale setting but Miyazaki knows exactly how far to take the story and the plot is peppered with gosh wow moments and threaded with his customary morality and warnings about abusing the power of nature The design work on Laputa nearly twenty years later is still revolutionary Flying machines of all sorts abound utterly impossible but so meticulously designed that you instantly accept them without blinking The world is set somewhere around the start of the twentieth century with telegraphs and ancient motorcars alongside those wonderful impossible flying machines But it is the city itself that is sheer brilliance in execution Laputa is both the Garden of Eden and the Fire of Heaven itself and in that juxtaposition lies its appeal its power and its danger Besides being a thoughtfully designed and beautifully rendered film Laputa is blessed with a wonderful sense of cinematography From sweeping flying shots to high speed chases on tiny one man flyers to ships submerging into the clouds as if they were water Laputa displays a scope that most films even with the magic of CGI can only daydream about Though we only see a small fraction of this world its simple elegance extends beyond the borders of the frame and we have no trouble believing in it The film also contains one of my favorite if not the most exciting action sequences ever a guardian robot that fell to Earth is accidentally reactivated and wreaks havoc on the fortress it is kept in all the while trying to protect Sheeta who was the one who woke it up Meanwhile Pazu and the pirates swoop in on their little flying machines to snatch her literally from the jaws of destruction From the horrific sight of the robot incinerating the countryside to the exhilarating last second rescue the entire sequence is a masterpiece of timing and camera angles and knowing exactly how far to take the audience It helps that Laputa has an amazing score Composer Joe Hisaishi captures the wondrous beauty of this world the dewy innocence the exciting action and the creepy otherworldliness of the flying city and its bizarre robot guardians Though he re recorded it for this DVD release which IMO is not an improvement over his original score adding pieces here and there the score matches the visuals perfectly a rare total union of sound and vision This isn t a bad dub I m inordinately fond of the older English dub and this one over explains things just a tad in spots but I was almost shocked how closely these voices matched those and those matched the Japanese pretty well Dola in particular is hard to get right but Leachman is spot on as the fiery old pirate woman her sons aren t quite as good as the original Paquin does a good job as Sheeta and Mark Hamill while I knew it was him early is more than talented enough to do Muska I liked the other English dub of Muska a little more but Hamill s good Much of the film rests on Pazu s shoulders and Van Der Beek is wonderful Listening to him made me think this crew must have had access to the other English dub because VDB matches up very closely with the original Pazu Although again watching a dub is grounds for excommunication among the otaku faithful as much as I love this film I don t think you re sacrificing a great deal simply watching this particular Anglicized version John Lassiter of Pixar introduces it up front and my suspicion is that he like so many others simply love this film so much that they tried very hard to ensure its high quality Miyazaki has had success in America in recent years with Spirited Away and Mononoke one of his few films I didn t care for but to me Laputa is still his crowning achievement Anyone familiar with his later work will almost certainly enjoy this earlier work and again this film is a master at the top of his form hitting on every cylinder I d pay big money to be able to see this on a large screen while that will probably never happen it s good to know that at least this classic has been preserved on DVD
1	Nicolas Mallet is a failure A teller in a bank everyone walks all over him Then his friend a writer who s books no one likes has a plan to change his life Our hero tells his boss he is quitting He intends to spend the rest of his life making a great deal of money and sleeping with a great many women And he manages to do just that If it were not for the amount of death murder suicide natural causes in the film this would be a farce There are numerous jabs at marriage politics journalism and life Jean Louis Trintignant is a likable amoral rogue Romy Schneider is at her most appealing Definitely worth a look
0	Mario Lewis of the Competitive Enterprise Institute has written a definitive page point by point line by line refutation of this mendacious film which should be titled A CONVENIENT LIE The website address where his debunking report which is titled A SKEPTIC S GUIDE TO AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH can be found at is www cei org A shorter page version can be found at www cei org pdf pdf Once you read those demolitions you ll realize that alleged global warming is no more real or dangerous than the Y K scare of which Gore also endorsed as he did the pseudo scientific film THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW which was based on a book written by alleged UFO abductee Whitley Strieber As James The Amazing Randi does to psychics and Philip Klass does to UFOs and Gerald Posner does to JFK conspir idiocy theories so does Mario Lewis does to Al Gore s movie and the whole global warming scam
0	Julia Roberts obviously makes a concerted effort to shake off her cotton wool Pretty Woman persona with this spurious spousal abuse thriller but it s hard to imagine she d end up putting in a performance as powerful and convincing and oscar winning as she did in Erin Brokovich based on the back of this rubbish And make no bones about it it s nothing more than a Julia Roberts vehicle but unfortunately her performance is not the most lacklustre thing about it The plot has all the markings of a late night made for cable and don t be under the impression that it will offer any insight into the dark world of domestic abuse because non of the characters are sketched out enough for you to really care Ultimately disappointing and unsatisfying without Roberts name above the title I m sure it would have totally flopped deservedly
0	The film began with Wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend Her aunt Edna May Oliver a person too talented for this film didn t like Wheeler a sentiment I can easily relate to The aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from Wheeler They left and Wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king At about the same time Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king So when Wheeler arrived it was up to the boys to fight it out but they refused because they are already friends which greatly disappointed the people as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime I am a huge fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywood the silent era through the s I have seen and reviewed hundreds if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films I have never been able to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolsey the only comedy team that might be as bad as the Ritz Brothers Despite being very successful in their short careers in Hollywood cut short due to the early death of Robert Woolsey I can t help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better For example there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the Marx Brother s film DUCK SOUP yet CRACKED NUTS never made me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a silly and highly enjoyable romp At times Woolsey talked a bit like Groucho but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny In fact he just seemed to prattle pointlessly His only funny quality was that he looked goofy surely not enough reason to put him on film Additionally Wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese a piece of cheese that sang very poorly A missed opportunity was the old Vaudeville routine later popularized by Abbott and Costello as who s on first which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing In fact soon after they started their spiel they just ended the routine so prematurely that you are left frustrated I knew that who s on first had been around for many years and used by many teams but I really wanted to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist Once again I have found yet another sub par film by this duo While I must admit that I liked a few of their films mildly such as SILLY BILLIES and THE RAINMAKERS which I actually gave s to on IMDb this one was a major endurance test to complete something that I find happens all too often when I view the films of Wheeler and Woolsey Where was all the humor
0	May contain spoilers If LIVING ON TOKYO TIME were some bold experiment where real life wanna be actors were given film parts on the condition that they would be required to take a combination of powerful prescription anti anxiety anti depression and anti psychotic medications this is the classic psych ward combo that renders patients into drooling zombies all during filming then this movie would hold far more interest Or if the film production was another type of experiment where all of the actors were sleep deprived before and during filming then TOKYO TIME could be more easily explained As it is this film is filled with lifeless low energy actors In the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking with his sister it appeared that he was having trouble keeping his eyes open In almost every scene he speaks his lines sitting down with every part of his body motionless From beginning to end his facial expression is best described as near sleep Fret not about the actors speaking over each other s lines because these actors can barely finish droning out any lines of dialog Everyone speaks with a depressing monotone voice No laughing No yelling No vigor No one has energy enough to crack a smile The result complete and total boredom And it does not help matters that the direction is simple and amateurish Avoid this lifeless film at all costs Better to watch GREENCARD which has a similar plot and has charm and energy Or for an unconventional Japanese romance story check out THE LONG VACATION which has an ample amount of everything LIVING ON TOKYO TIME does not
1	I rate this out of Why It offers insight into something I barely understand the surfers surf because it s all they want to do Nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing Nor is it a temporary thing it s a lifetime for these guys Buried in the movie is a great history of surfing I have never surfed but I love surfing movies and have seen many None taught me what this movie did The movie was very well edited It flowed well The interviews were outstanding It s interesting from start to finishIn summary it s about as good as a documentary as I have seen so I have to rate in terms of that So
1	The film had many fundamental values of family and love It expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story The script was clear it was very easy to understand making it perfect for children and was enjoyable and humorous at times There were a few charged symbols to look for The cinematography was acceptable There was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing today which quiet frankly is getting a little warn out It was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it Although editing could have been done better I thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy And the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something I didn t like either but in all it was a good movie
1	I sit through movies like Tiempo de valientes and I want to talk about cinema for hours The admiration this movie caused me is beyond my own limits of explanation because I m watching the scenes of the film and I search inside my thoughts for film making ideas and dialogue innovations that could emerge from something bigger than Damian Szifron s mind Looking the environment so uncompromised so simple I m thinking this man is a genius No wonder he created what is probably the best television show Argentina ever witnessed and then a first movie full of elements some contemporary directors haven t still achieved El fondo del mar is the name and it awakened a few years ago my enthusiasm for our everyday cinema Starting his journey from people s daily real lives Szifron goes where Pablo Trapero never could in El Bonaerense the Federal Police Department s life Trapero s film was a journey into a man s mind and experiences not into the places he saw Yes there was a detailed training and lots of crime situations but Szifron in in there his is more of a detective story like the ones we know and love with the mysteries and the thrilling music But there s a lot of humanity in his writing and he shows us his investigation through the eyes of his main characters Alfredo D az and Mariano Silverstein There are a lot of actors of great caliber in the film but these two actors are the ones the film can t do without The first character Luis Luque is a detective that has just found out his wife cheats on him and has to work on a case The second one is a psychiatrist that is assigned the treatment of the detective He wants to deal with him in regular sessions but the sheriff takes advantage of the time disposition and suggests he joins D az in his routines It s nothing the usual stuff no problem But it is bigger than that and it will unfold a part of the doctor s personality he didn t know The relationship developed between the two leads can t be explained unless it is observed because it regards such a complexity that demonstrates how talented are some men like Szifron that are trying today to leave a signature in our history Reaching points of unbelievable spontaneity during a high pressure situation D az tells Silverstein How do we continue our treatment and Silverstein answers No I m not your doctor You call me to have dinner I m your friend we laugh because we can t help it And we can t help laughing when D az crashes a car in the street and doesn t gives importance to it or when he trespasses all the red lights in the street or when he smokes pot in his police patrol and Silverstein can t believe it but then smokes it too because he s screwed up or when Silverstein tries to be friendly with D az s robber friends Magic from Diego Peretti is what we receive there He a psychiatrist himself gives a performance in plan Locas de amor but impresses with all his range Luis Luque on the other hand is back on track with a top notch portrayal that reminds us the great actor he is There s a passion I have for this and as I said I could write about it for hours but unfortunately that s not the way it works and I have to be precise and summarize Although I have to watch a lot of the old movies and study them I could assure that Tiempo de valientes is the comedy Argentina had been waiting for and never got Until now
1	A glacier slide inside a cavernous ice mountain sends its three characters whoosh down a never ending wet slide tube that has enough kick to dazzle kids the same way mature audience may be dazzled by the star gate sequence that closes A Space Odyssey Miles apart in vision but it is a scene of great rush and excitement nonetheless A magnificent opening sequence also takes place where a furry squirrel like critter attempts to hide his precious acorn You ve probably seen this scene in the trailer but as it takes place he starts a domino effect when the mountain starts cracking and results an avalanche The horror just keeps going as the critter tries to outrun the impossible The movie traces two characters a mammoth named Manfred Ray Romano and a buck toothed sloth John Leguizamo as they try to migrate south They find a human baby they adopt and then decide to track the parent figures down to return to them They are joined by a saber tiger named Diego Denis Leary whose predatory intentions is to bring the baby to his tiger clan by leading the mammoth and the sloth into a trap Diego s meat eating family wants the mammoth most of all but Diego s learned values of friendship make easy what choice to ultimately make at the end There are fatalistic natural dangers of the world along the trip including an erupted volcano and a glacier bridge that threatens to melt momentarily that is reminiscent of the castle escape in Shrek Characters contemplate on why they re in the Ice Age while they could have called it The Big Chill or the Nippy Era Some characters wish for a forthcoming global warming Another great line about the mating issues between girlfriends All the great guys are never around The sensitive ones get eaten Throwaway lines galore whimsical comedy and light fingered adventure makes this one pretty easy to watch Also food is so scarce for the nice vegetarians that they consider dandelions and pine cones as good eating The vocal talents of Romano Leguizamo and Leary make good on their personas while the children will delight in their antics the adults will fancy their riffs on their own talents There is some mild violence and intense content but kids will be jazzed by the excitement and will get one of their early introductions of the age old battle of good versus evil and family tradition and friendship are strong thematic ties The animators also make majestic use of background landscapes that are coolly fantastic
1	Depardieu s most notorious film is this groundbreaker from Bertrand Blier It features many highly sexual scenes verging on an X rating including one of Jeanne Moreau doing a hot s version of her Jules and Jim menage a trois with the two hairy French hippies Depardieu and Deware There is no such thing as a sacred territory in this film everything is fair game It s very odd that Americans tend to not like this film very much while many French people I ve met consider it a classic Something about it goes against what Americans have been programmed to like Gerard and the late Patrick Deware are two bitch slapping hippy drifters with many sexual insecurities going around molesting women and committing petty crimes They re out for kicks and anti capitalist Euro commie slacker freedom Blier satirizes the hell out of these two guys while at the same time making bourgeois society itself look ultimately much more ridiculous Best of all though is the way the wonderful Stephane Grappelli score conveys the restless soul of the drifters the deeper subconscious awareness or higher ideal that motivates all the follies they engage in
1	This is a wonderful movie about the struggle of the Mormons and their final settlement in Salt Lake Utah The beginning and the ending are especially powerful and the message is one we all have to be reminded of God doesn t talk but he communicates if we would only listen As I am writing this in the midst of the horrors going on in New Orleans and the surrounding area due to Katrina I was especially moved by the Mormons having to leave everything behind and move on after Joseph Smith was assassinated People came to this country to escape religious persecution and yet they could not The struggle of the Mormons to cross the country the cost in lives the hardship they suffered was truly awe inspiring demonstrating their tremendous strength As far as the actual beliefs of Mormons this is not heavily gone into and polygamy is mentioned but is not a centerpiece of the film at all The cast is top notch though others who have commented know more about the actual characters and can talk about how true the portrayals were But as actors Dean Jagger Mary Astor Brian Donlevy John Carradine Jane Darwell all do excellently with the script they were given Though the film could have easily stood on its own and certainly does today Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell were added to the cast to get the crowds into the movie theaters to see a film about the Mormons Power is magnificently handsome as a young Mormon and Darnell as Zina is not a Mormon but stays on with the family after her father is killed Power does not have much to do until the end of the film when he has a big scene and Darnell still a teenager at the time of the filming has even less though they make a lovely couple Their fate is left unclear regarding her conversion and one does wonder about the polygamy in their case You can t beat either one for eye candy however
0	The premise is amazing and the some of the acting notably Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp is charming but this film is near unwatchable The music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap Most of the singing is off key I think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it The dialogue is really stupid and trite The movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub plots I found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after wondering when is it ever going to end
0	and that s only because I don t go lower with my ratings skip this movie and wait for the last movie of the Trilogy don t buy or rent it trust me you won t be missing a thing the Architect brings no new info spoiler there have been more NEO s before him he s like nr or something you could already figure something like that out from the first movie Agent Smith telling us the first Matrix created didn t work because it was too perfect Trinity died and Neo s love brought her back where have I seen this before Oh right in the first movie the roles where reversed same as the action scenes nothing new just with more opponents the Action scene the ships in the BIG battle which we didn t see maybe in Revolutions betrayed by someone hmmmm maybe the guy holding the knife who wanted to stab Neo who pushed the EGM button to soon all in all a shameless ploy to make money especially off the guys who went to see it more then once which evidently worked like a charm
1	This movie blows you off your feet This debut movie from Tom Barman known from the Belgian rock band dEUS introduces you to intriguing people building blocks of a compelling movie mosaic They each survive one day and one night in the metropole of Antwerp Barman paints his characters with great deal of verve and competently interweaves their individual stories a tour the force that reminds of the best work of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson The patchwork of anecdotes surprises moves amuses the dialogues are so natural they seem to be improvised Some great performances by Matthias Schoenaerts Natali Broods and the extremely funny duo from Ghent Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt Sam Louwyck is the memorable Windman a bizarre guy dancing throughout the movie Sam is also responsible for the stunning choreography and of course Tom Barman himself took care of the ultra cool Sound Track We were seriously impressed Any Way The Wind Blows is a movie that blows you off your feet
1	Some have compared this film to Deliverance I believe Of Mice and Men is more appropriate Our leading man Heaton definitely loves Spike It is irrelevant and immaterial whether that is a sexual love It is the reason Heaton does not leave Spike He needs him They need each other As brothers as family as their only connection to humanity The setting scenario minimal cast all add up to a fine film Frankly I did not care what happened to the characters But I did care about what the film maker did with them He did well with them I spent some time wondering how the ending would resemble Of Mice and Men The soundtrack and cinematography were compelling and intriguing
1	this is one amazing movie you have to realize that chinese folklore is complicated and philosophical there are always stories behind stories i myself did not understand everything but knowing chinese folklore i studied them in school it is very complicated you just have to take what it gives you ENJOY THE MOVIE AND ENJOY THE RIDE HOORAY
0	you know the rest If you want a good zombie movie DON T RENT THIS MOVIE If you want a documentary esquire look at hood life you re at the wrong place as well If you re looking for a laughable piece of film this is a real winner The acting is as flat as a piece of paper The best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive by I can tell that he did the voice for the operator as well by the flat tone of his voice If I could hear a cardboard box talk it d probably sound like this guy Oh yea and the zombies did their best snake impression which is on par with their FANTASTIC acting overall note sarcasm HOW DID THIS NOT WIN AN Oscar FOR BEST MAKE UP The Quiroz did not do any sort of directing I felt like I was watching an improvisational period piece the period is more like s LA The direction is however one uped by the worst script I think to ever grace a movie I haven t heard such lovely lines like the epic one word beginning to the movie F k since Ice Grill which was another urban thriller This only works of course in conjunction with the also epic hip hop soundtrack All or so songs of it All in all what the hell did you expect from a movie entitled Hood of the Living Dead I rented this movie with full intention to laugh at its every scene and boy it delivered and MORE I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of guys and laugh at a low budget horror yea right movie for the night A memorable experience for sure
0	Whoa boy Ever wanted to watch a documentary about a megalomaniacal jerk ruining his own life and alienating everyone around him Well they exist in many forms But have you ever wanted to watch said documentary about one who didn t ultimately succeed in doing anything despite everyone s praises about how much of an artistic genius he is Well you could probably just grab a camera and find someone like that in any local scene I know they re everywhere and I don t even follow the local scene or you could save yourself the trouble by spending money watching this tripe The premise is good and honestly it s not as if the filmmakers knew precisely where it was going considering that s one of the difficulties of doing a documentary We are made to follow two bands The Brian Jamestown Massacre lead by Anton and The Dandy Warhols lead by Courtney I ve heard of The Dandy Warhols before watching this movie not so the Brian Jamestown Massacre Why Well from this documentary s perspective because The Brian Jamestown Massacre s intergroup dysfunction refused them the ability to really make it in the music industry However instead of this becoming an analysis of the two separate bands and how one was able to succeed the focus becomes much more on Anton and his insanity Because see Anton is a genius Because he plays rock music He really understands the evolution of music because he plays rock music with a lot of different instruments His music is considered post modern retro but the future because it s rock music He wants to bring out a revolution through rock music Okay so let s face it twenty minutes in and this is one of the stupidest kids I d care to watch a documentary about The documentary itself doesn t really lend itself to showcasing any of Anton s talent because in the nature of editing down hours of material into a quarter short of two hours we don t really have the time to focus on that So instead we watch Anton the genius the socio maniacal loser be a jerk for the two hours and are just told to understand that he made really great music Whether he did or not I won t know because its not like the documentary had enough time to prove it What I do know is that then we re left with a story about some self centered obnoxious twerp running around the country calling himself a God of music and doing nothing to back it up Why even bother watching that People like Anton don t deserve the attention they seek the hope and admiration of all those different people and especially a post failure paean to lost potential This movie plays like a two hour rough cut VH special for a reason he goes on and on about the music but it s all about the image and the attention Look at the guy look at how he dresses look at how he acts look at how he tries to create controversy because he can t afford marketing Honestly the only interesting character in this film is Joel and that s because of anyone in this documentary Joel is the only person who seems to have any fun Maybe it s because he s the tambourine man The rest of them are all rock stars They deserve our attention and admiration and interest and engagements They are out there to save rock and roll Do you remember when The White Stripes were supposed to save rock and roll Yeah that was because of Anton and it s selfish of them not to mention me Anton as an inspiration What a load People like Anton are best left forgotten This documentary explains why mainstream music is so dull because music execs have to deal with people like Anton for a living and ultimately can only really throw their support behind someone safe and passionless Thanks a lot Anton Your antics ruined music for EVERYONE you touched whatever the opinion to the contrary is And if people in the know about Anton disagree and he really was a genius it still shows how bad this documentary is that it cuts it down that way PolarisDiB
1	This man is nothing short of amazing You truly feel as if you have lived his life with him throughout these tragic events and cry along with his family in the end He was so passionate about his cause not just for himself but to ensure others who will survive him do not have to go through this wretched pain I watch this video every time I am having a bad or down day and it always manages to make me see the great and brighter side of life just like Jonny did even with his unbearable pain My only regret is not knowing about Jonny sooner as I visited England times during his life and would have been able to say I d met him It is comforting to know Jonny is sitting on his cloud pain free Rest in peace Dear Jonny You deserve it
0	you must be seeing my comments over many films under Evren Buyruk I am off to make another comment over a movie that is not even worth a minute of talking though This film is basically two hours of Dafoe s character drinking himself nearly literally to death The only surprise in this film is that you didn t have enough clues or character knowledge to be surprised It was just a grim sad waste of time Willem Dafoe is excellent actor Peter Stormare is an excellent actor But this film just sucked Slow doesn t make the movie bad it was just bad The sketchy plot mixed with artistic ramblings of anamorphic detail aren t cohesively drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot except to highlight some gore which is illustrated from several perspectives finally at the end I really appreciate the artistic vision but as entertainment it put me to sleep Seriously I fell asleep and had to re watch the film which was even more disappointing I generally don t like to make negative comments or reviews on the works of others even when they suck but this film warranted one It s just too bad that these great actors were shamed with this end result
1	Robin Williams does his best to combine comedy and pathos but comes off a bit shrill Donald Moffat is too one note as his father in law Jeff Bridges is excellent though as the quarterback and Holly Palance and Pamela Reed are marvelous carrying the film through most of its rough spots It fills time nicely but is little more than that
0	This film was a disaster from start to finish Interspersed with performances from the next generation of beautiful losers are interviews with Bono and The Edge as well as the performers themselves This leaves little time for the clips of Leonard Cohen himself who towers over everyone else in the film with his commanding yet gentle presence wisdom and humor The rest are too busy trying to canonize him as St Leonard or as some Old Testament prophet Many of the performances are forgettable over interpretations especially Rufus Martha Wainright s or bland under achievements Only Beth Orton and Anthony got within striking distance of Leonard s own versions by using a little restraint Annoying little pseudo avant garde gestures are sprinkled throughout the film like out of focus superimpositions of red spheres over many of the concert and interview shots shaky blurred camera work use of digital delay on some of Leonard Cohen s comments making it harder to hear what s being said and a spooky pretentious low drone under a lot of the interview segments an attempt at added gravitas For the real thing see the Songs From The Life Of documentary produced by the BBC in
1	This is one of the most brilliant movies that I have seen in recent times Goes way above even any international movie of any repute I am really surprised why this has not received the recognition it deserved Sonali Kulkarni winning the National Award is perhaps the only consoling fact Renuka Daftardar simply amazes as she speaks volumes through her eyes There are a few scenes that stand out When Gauri comes back from the city on Krishna s wedding she and Krishna meet for the first time in many years Krishna notices a change in Gauri but not a single line of dialogue is said The entire gamut of emotions is conveyed through subtle mannerisms and the eyes There s another towards the end when Krishna pleads to Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gauri instead If you are not moved by that scene you don t have a heart Watch this movie for sheer movie making brilliance and acting capabilities
0	The only way we survived this stinker was by continually making fun of its stupidity Funny thing is none of the audience around us seemed to mind we all joined in This movie is soooo bad its only potential is to become a midnight cult movie that people can invent lines and throw popcorn at

0	During the cheap filmed in video beginning of Crazy Fat Ethel II I wondered if it was the same film that was on the cover Unfortunately it was The story itself is mindlessly simple Ethel a homicidal maniac with an eating disorder is released into a halfway house because of hospital overcrowding She is by far the most sane resident watching while one man puts dead flies into another s soup Ethel is then teased by one of the halfway house employees with a chocolate bar after he hits on the cost cutting measure of feeding the residents dog food Ethel retaliates by strangling him with a wire noose on the stairs and then well you get the idea If this all sounds like fun it isn t This film was poorly made with cheap effects and even worse acting The characters are so wooden when delivering their lines that they should be standing out in front of a cigar store To make matters worse half of the film consists of flashbacks to the first Ethel movie Criminally Insane which is little better A VERY poor effort
1	The movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of Baghdad the jailed prince meets a thief called Abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called Basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with but unbeknown to him the evil wizard Jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her Jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns Abu into a dog This leads to the prince and Abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat Jafa restore peace to Baghdad and marry the princess during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic Genies that takes Abu on a flight through the clouds a giant spider that s really hungry and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen This is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses genies flying carpets and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs It doesn t have any cheesy moments and the love story isn t a waste of time The production designs are just stunning in this movie From the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter Even though this movie is over years old the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in today s cinema The music and songs are also well done Anyone who sees it will no doubt hail I want to be a sailor sailing on the seas as one of the great musical moments in movies I m usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since I find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but I ll be more than happy to make an exception for this movie What sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you don t see in everyday life which is also the same reason why I love stuff like Two Towers and Silent Hill Way before today s modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic CGI to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place One of my favorite shots in Two Towers is the one where we see the trolls opening the Black Gates the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor and that s what I love about the Genie and other creatures in the movie They re just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they re all just fantasy beings It s literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of Aladdin got their inspiration The characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative Genie right down to the flying carpet It s not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it s nice to know that I m not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie I first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week I still think it s amazing That s a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time Sure the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the s so give it a break Not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under today s standard If you ever wanted to see a live action version of Aladdin then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won t be their cup of tea
1	What a stunning episode for this fine series This is television excellence at its best The story takes place in and it s beautifully filmed in black white almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images This is a story about two men who fall in love but I don t want to spoil this It is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the s in America Written by the superb Tom Pettit and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc we move through their lives their love for each other and their tragedy Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning Our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters Chills ran up my spine at the end when they played Bob Dylan s gorgeous Ah but I was so much older then I m younger than that now as sung by the Byrds This one goes far past a and all the way to the stars Beautiful
1	I am a huge fan of Vonnegut s work and I m very fond of this movie but I wouldn t say that this is a film of the Mother Night that I read When people say that Vonnegut is unfilmable two things come to my mind One is that many of his themes are very near the knuckle or even taboo despite the accusation sometimes used against him that he chooses relatively easy targets for his satire This means less every day that passes as far as filmability is concerned Directors these days appear to revel in breaking taboos and I have high hopes for the version of Bluebeard now in production Amazing to think that an innocent piece like Vonnegut s Sirens of Titan would probably have been the equivalent of R rated if filmed when it was published back in the s for its violence language and sexual and thematic content though it s a tragedy that nobody s come up yet with a filmable script for it And in the present economic climate I also hope some director out there is looking closely at Jailbird Galapagos and Hocus Pocus The other thing is his narrative style heaping irony upon irony upon irony but still making it hilariously funny It seems impossible to objectify and that appears to be the biggest obstacle to making great films of his great novels because the little authorial comments that colour our response as readers are just not possible in movies without resorting to too often clumsy techniques like talkovers Vonnegut suggested that there was a character missing from filmed versions of his work himself as author narrator To its credit Breakfast of Champions the movie tried to keep the comedy and came a bit of a cropper for its pains As did another turkey made from a Vonnegut novel Slapstick in an even more spectacular way Still there s nothing wrong with a director giving us his subjective interpretation of Vonnegut and Mother Night is an excellent example of how as another reviewer put it a good director can add a visual poetry to a source like this But so much of the humour is lost that though it s the same plot it s not really from the same novel I read If it had been I d probably have been rolling in the aisles laughing a few times watching it For a reader of the novel I think a chuckle even at the end is forgivable The end of the film however is truly poignant and I think one of the film s successes is that it can genuinely leave you feeling that you ve watched someone walk a razor s edge between good and evil and the jury is still out Standing alone and of itself it s well worth a look Technically there are some minor but glaring errors notably in continuity and it too often looks drab and theatrical but most of the time it hits an acceptable note and occasionally shows considerable imagination and resourcefulness The acting in general is of a high order even if maybe the dialogue is by today s standards a little stilted It survives quite well watching back to back with Slaughterhouse and there is actually quite a bit more good filmed Vonnegut out there mostly versions of his short stories Harrison Bergeron Who Am I This Time and some other things like of course the misfiring filmed version of his very funny but disposable play Happy Birthday Wanda June Also there was an interesting piece if it still exists done in the s called Between Time And Timbuktu which Vonnegut apparently didn t like much although he was involved in its production because he felt it misinterpreted him in its generality He said it reminded him of the bizarre surgical experiments performed in the HG Wells tale The Island of Dr Moreau but it did for many people serve as an excellent introduction to his work But if the films don t make you want to go to the superior source material they re not doing their job As the man said more or less the big show is inside your head
1	We viewed the vcr and found it to be fascinating Not knowing anything about this true story I thought Oh no P Brosnan as an American Indian red Indian in the film what a bad choice until I discovered the truth about Grey Owl The film does a good job of demonstrating the dignity of these native peoples and undermining the racist myths about them And Annie Galipeau WOW what a beauty and very convincing as an Indian woman I believe she is French Canadian she sure reverts to the all too familiar speech of such In spite of Brosnan s detached grunting style in the end he comes through convincingly as a passionate dedicated man The plot is a little weak in demostrating his conversion from trapper to animal coservationist Good film highly recommended
1	This is your standard musical comedy from the s with a big plus that it features some well known s actors in small fun cameo s There is not much to the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and no worries overall kind of atmosphere with a typical Hal Roach comedy touch to it Appereantly it s a Cinderella story but I most certainly didn t thought of it that way while watching the movie The story gets very muddled in into the storytelling that features many different characters and also many small cameo appearance when the main characters hit the Hollywood studios Of course the highlight of the movie is when Laurel Hardy make their appearance and show some of their routines It s like watching a movie and getting a Laurel Hardy short with it for free Also Laurel Hardy regular Walter Long makes an appearance in the routine and James Finlayson without a mustache this time as the director of the short It s certainly true that all of the cameo s and subplots distract from the main plot line and character but in this case that is no problem since its all way more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot line and the shallow typical main character The movie is most certainly not any worse than any of its other genre movies from the same time period though the rating on here would suggest otherwise
1	I saw it at Cinema MK Hautefeuille just one night after its first public projection in Paris A very pretty film about three years old teenagers all of them just at about the same psychologically stages Many of the scenes let us to come back to our adolescence age our first feelings about sexual relations it is possible to imagine that the director would like to reduce the first strong sensual feelings of the girls to lesbianism but even in that case she doesn t corrupt the likelihood of the story You can sometimes find the film a little slow but it is what creates this intimate atmosphere I fund the young actresses of talent special mention with Floriane and Marie very convincing There are many small details but this film also enabled me to discover what synchronized swimming is impressing
1	This is a straight to video movie so it should go without saying that it s not going to rival the first Lion King but that said this was downright good My kids loved this but that s a given they love anything that s a cartoon The big shock was that I liked it too it was laugh out loud funny at some parts even the fart jokes had lots of rather creative tie ins with the first movie and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand but without being risqu like in Shrek do you think he s compensating for something A special note on the fart jokes I was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noises in fact there were almost no noises imagery at all the references were actually rather subtle they actually had a setup punchline etc and were almost in good taste I d like my kids to think that there s more to humor than going to the bathroom and this movie is fine in those regards Hmm what else The music was so so not nearly as creative as in the first or second movie but plenty of fun for the kids No painfully corny moments which was a blessing for me A little action but nothing too scary the Secret of NIMH gave my kids nightmares not sure a G rating was appropriate for that one All in all I d say this is a great movie for kids of any age one that s safe to let them watch I try not to be overly sensitive but I ve had to jump up and turn off the TV during a few movies that were less kid appropriate than expected but you re safe to leave the room during this one I d say stick around anyway though you might find that you enjoy it too
0	I have been a huge Lynn Peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the blockbuster movie Far North and even though I loved her in her one other film Slow where she plays Francis this is by far and away her strongest role Lynn as I m sure you all know or should plays the critical role of Driver Unfortunately other than Lynn s amazing performance I m afraid this movie doesn t really have much going for it Oh wait there was one other thing the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for TV viewers Memorable lines like You son of a gun You son of a witch Shoot and Well Forget You O K Bye P S Does anyone know where I can get another Lynn Peterson poster
1	Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most surprising and delightful film I ve seen all year It s about a prison program somewhere in California if I recall correctly where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different Shakespeare play every year for the past years The film follows their production of The Tempest from casting through performance and in the process we learn some pretty amazing things about these men who are all in for the most serious of crimes Truth is indeed stranger than fiction if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film the audience would never buy it but knowing that it s real makes it breathtaking to watch literally I gasped out loud when I learned of one particularly gifted felon s crime It s like some loopy episode of Oz and all the more entertaining because the characters and their bizarre stories are real
0	I was eager to see Mr Fix It because I m a huge David Boreanaz fan What I got though was a hour nap The premise seemed enjoyable Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen proprietor of a business called Mr Fix It where dumped men enlist his help to get their girlfriends to take them back Among the problems with this movie are the editing script and acting Although I ve found Boreanaz delightful in his other film roles with the exception of that Crow movie he did this was disappointing At times his character was interesting and others flat The supporting cast reminded me of soap opera day players I realize it wasn t a big budget film but some of the scene cuts and music just didn t seem right My advice watch at your own risk
0	I have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties I finally found it on DVD at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie The story is set around amazon jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil Laura Crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in South America They take her into the jungle Laura is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself The Devil she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy Maidens are Chained up The devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner Peter Weston is the devil hunter who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her
1	Okay so there is a front view of a Checker taxi probably late s model It has the great triangular shaped headlights There also is a DeSoto cab in this black and white character driven almost a musical love gone wrong story The real pleasure here is the look at s room interiors and fashions and hotel elevators The hair styles male and female are gorgeous If Dolly Parton had Victor Mature s hair she could have made it big There is an artist loft that would be the envy of every Andy Warhol wannabe If you watch this expecting a great Casablanca storyline or Sound of Music oom pah pah you will be disappointed There is a nice little story beneath the runway model approach in this film My copy on DVD with another movie for was very viewable The title sequence was cute but not up there with Mad Mad Mad Mad World or The Pink Panther This was an RKO movie but it did not have the nice airplane logo that RKO used to use I liked Victor Mature in One Million B C and Sampson and Delilah and especially in Violent Saturday See if you can find that one He was wonderful in the comedy with Peter Sellers called Caccia Alla Volpe or After The Fox Richard Carlson went on to do I Led Three Lives on TV in the early s Vic Mature was offered the part of Sampson s father in the remake of Sampson and Delilah He supposedly was asked if he would have any problems playing the part of the father since he was so well known as Sampson Victor replied If the money is right I ll play Sampson s mother Tom Willett
0	The Gospel of Lou was a major disappointment for me I had received an E Mail from the theater showing it that it was a great and inspirational movie It was neither great nor inspirational The cinematography was pretty iffy with the whole movie A lot the scenes were flash backs that were done in a way that couldn t tell at times what they were about The voices were often distorted for no reason Also many of the people in the movie were far fetched The relationship he has with his ex son is never made clear Also the whole movie has most him one way and then all of a sudden BAM he is cured and inspiring people The whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the things that is bad in his life making him live his life the way that he is living it but when he changes he doesn t leave boxing he teaches others how to box Thumbs Down
0	This film limps from self indulgent moment to self indulgent moment promising to develop into something worth hanging on for But it doesn t It s flat self conscious unimaginative and tedious A series of set images and backdrops don t make a film they make a calendar This kind of pitiful socialist pseudo drama documentary It s TRUE it REALLY happened not only fails to entertain it fails to convince so it doesn t even function as social history Clich s co mingled with bad acting make this a film very difficult to finish the amusement factor wearing off fairly quickly The characters are one dimensional never developing to the extent that one feels for them The director s ego is the largest character in this film
0	Doppelganger has its moments but they are few and far between Essentially this is a grade B blend of pop psych thriller ghost story and horror Drew Barrymore plays a young woman who is haunted by the demons of her past most of her family has been murdered and she was in at least one case the prime suspect or does she just have a really bad case of multiple personality disorder George Newbern is her new room mate and most of the action centers on him Newbern s character is pretty sympathetic and both he and Barrymore do decent work though not exactly good The mediocre to at times totally horrendous script and the unimpressive directing seem to have combined to sink the rest of the performances into oblivion Leslie Hope s character is memorable but so irritating that you will want to forget her The plot eventually disintegrates into a bifurcated one story arc is psychological realism the other is supernatural horror outlandish climax which is so badly conceived acted and photographed that it effectively counteracts most of what value the film had achieved previously Overall the film has the feel of what might expect to be the result of M Knight Shamalyan s first undergraduate film class The acting and script for the two leads are just good enough to make you care a little about them at least until the film derails utterly and completely My recommendation send your doppelganger but avoid a first person encounter
0	While most of the movie is very amateurish the Kosher slaughter scene is played up but not untrue Kosher law says that an animal must be conscious when the blade touches it s skin The Kosher slaughter scene is accurate as anyone knows who has seen one or has seen the Peta film showing a Kosher slaughter in which the animals throat is cut and the esophagus cut out while it is still alive conscious and obviously suffering We must remember that history is written by the victors Is one even Allowed to even THINK that maybe the Nazis were right Doesn t it say anything that the Nazis had outlawed this vicious religious slaughter and the Jews are still practicing it even today
1	I have not seen this movie At least not in its entirety I have seen a few haunting clips which have left me gagging to see it all One sequence remains in my memory to this day A very convincing looking spacecraft is orbiting the dark side of the moon The pilot releases a flash device in order to photograph the hidden surface below him The moon flashes into visability and for a few seconds there it is Parallel lines squares Could it be then the light fades and the brief glimse of what has gone and it is time for the spacecraft to return to Earth Wonderful I have seen some other clips too but would LOVE to obtain the full movie
0	The plot of this terrible film is so convoluted I ve put the spoiler warning up because I m unsure if I m giving anything away The audience first sees some man in Jack the Ripper garb murder an old man in an alley a hundred years ago Then we re up to modern day and a young Australian couple is looking for a house We re given an unbelievably long tour of this house and the husband sees a figure in an old mirror Some year old woman lived there There are also large iron panels covering a wall in the den An old fashioned straight razor falls out when they re renovating and the husband keeps it I guess he becomes possessed by the razor because he starts having weird dreams Oh yeah the couple is unable to have a baby because the husband is firing blanks Some mold seems to be climbing up the wall after the couple removes the iron panels and the mold has the shape of a person Late in the story there is a plot about a large cache of money the husband murders the body guard a co worker and steals the money His wife is suddenly pregnant What the hell is going on Who knows NOTHING is explained Was the year old woman the child of the serial killer The baby sister WHY were iron panels put on the wall How would that keep the serial killer contained in the cellar Was he locked down there by his family starved to death or just concealed WHO is Mr Hobbs and why is he so desperate to get the iron panels He s never seen again WHY was the serial killer killing people We only see the one old man murdered Was there a pattern or motive or something WHY does the wife suddenly become pregnant Is it the demon spawn of the serial killer Has he managed to infiltrate the husband s semen And why if the husband was able to subdue and murder a huge burly security guard is he unable to overpower his wife And just how powerful is the voltage system in Australia that it would knock him across the room simply cutting a light wire And why does the wife stay in the house Is she now possessed by the serial killer Is the baby going to be the killer reincarnated This movie was such a frustrating experience I wanted to call my PBS station and ask for my money back The ONLY enjoyable aspect of this story was seeing the husband running around in just his boxer shorts for a lot of the time but even that couldn t redeem this muddled incoherent mess
1	Moonwalker by Michael Jackson is a real adventure film for the whole family Before the real story of the movie starts we get a performance of the Bad Tour Man In The Mirror and it kicks off a great movie After that we get a kind of a collage of Michael carrier as it was until Moonwalker came out in After a few Music Videos also Speed Demon Leave Me Alone etc the story starts The plot is basically that Michael and his friends who are kids are being chased by the bad guy of the story Mr Big because they discovered his evil plans of getting children all over the world hocked on drugs During the chase we see fantastic segments fx Michaels video for Smooth Criminal which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences etc But then one of the kids get kidnapped by Mr Big and Michael will haft to save her before she gets a drug addict During the movie we see special effects not only amazing for those days standards but also impressive today For instance see Michael turning in to a robot spaceship in order to protect his friends It s so cool The movie ends with a performance of Come Together later published in Michaels double album of HIStory and you leave the movie with a magic feeling Amazing I recommend this for every family who wants to spend a nice night together with candy and popcorn in front of the TV And now some parents might stand up and say But Michael Jackson is an alleged child abuser Yeah he is indeed but come on we all know it isn t true Wait and see
0	Yep this is definatly up there with some of the worst of the MSTifyed movies but I have definately seen worse Think Gremlins rated R Well anyway I met Rick Sloane at some sci fi convention that amazingly he was lecturing at It was one of those really low budget conventions where everything goes an everyone brought in something if you want to see crap you should have of seen what some friends and I brought in He seemed like a very nice guy he was very cool about my questions and comments on Hobgoblins and he even told me not to take it seriously and said he loved the MST K version All in all Rick Sloane knew what he was doing And I think was meant to bad like Mars Attacks So I guess I m standing up for this movie and giving it a and betraying all my fellow MSTies Sorry guys
0	Cartoon Network seems to be desperate for ratings Beginning with the cancellation of Samurai Jack the network seemed hellbent on removing all the shows that made it so popular such as the Powerpuff Girls Dexter s Lab Dragonball Z etc When the ratings started to plummet CN began putting up some pretty mediocre shows Though Total Drama Island Action and Chowder stand out because of their clever writing and audience pleasing gimmicks there are plenty of other shows that either terrible remakes George of the Jungle or rip offs of other shows such as The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack where the title character acts just like Spongebob and then there s Johnny Test which is something of a replacement for Dexter s Laboratory though it s much more of a sheer rip off than anything The show s characters are clearly derived from Dexter s Lab only this time the focus is on Johnny a blonde or fiery haired character who torments his twin sisters Susan and Mary who just HAPPEN to look just like Dexter from the orange hair to the glasses the impossible technology There is even a rival genius named Bling Bling Boy or Eugene who appears to be sitting in for Mandark Then there s Dookie Johnny s best friend and talking dog one of Dexter s I mean Susan and Mary s early experiments Dexter s Laboratory was probably one of the best cartoons on television with its simple but effective art style lovable main character and episodes that don t seem to be a long drag Johnny Test is a lot different The art style here isn t nearly as eye pleasing In fact it looks absolutely awful The characters have motivations that make them really annoying or repulsive Like how most of the series episodes consist Johnny and Dookie s quest for havoc on the neighborhood girl Sissy whom Johnny secretly likes or the twins obsession over a boy next door Seeing these two geniuses swoon at the sight of abs and the fact that Johnny appears to be someone you would NEVER want to associate with there is no real connection between the viewer and characters One thing the series heavily exploits in its name is that Johnny is Susan and Mary s guinea pig for their experiments These range from turning Johnny fat ugly monstrous and even into a woman The twins then help Johnny in whatever scheme he s planning in return for his services Whenever there s an episode involving this kind of win win deal it usually comes undone at the seems and those that doesn t come completely off the rails never ends satisfyingly The writing ranges from mediocre to horrid however The fat episode constantly repeats It s Phat with a PH There s a difference you know which is a line that should never be repeated especially when the episode seems to PROMOTE child obesity with Johnny becoming a famous star with money and videogames just by becoming fat Let s talk about how the show doesn t completely rip off Dexter s Lab The show tosses in a lot of characters from two Men in Black named Mr Black and Mr White a military general who seems to need all his problems solved through Johnny and his sisters and LOTS of super villains though even here the show again steals ideas for other sources like a Mr Freeze teenage clone an evil cat with a butler who wants cats to rule over man like the evil talking cat from Powerpuff Girls a bumbling maniac mastermind a trio of evil skater dudes and even a Mole Man which is probably the most clich villain in the media To top it all off alongside its ugly animation and unlikeable characters the voice acting is either passable like the voices for Mr Black and Mr White to just plain ear splitting Johnny Dookie and just about every villain in the show The theme song seems to be the only catchy thing to this show but then it was redone just a few episodes with a band that just ruined it So in the end Johnny Test is not a good cartoon Its horrible references and jokes about teen culture will dismantle little children s interest in the show while its bright coloring ripped off characters and dragging episodes will ruin the experience for teens It s just another one of those crappy shows that Cartoon Network is over promoting to trick people to watching it like MTV toward rap If you need a show that will satisfy your children for a half hour you d better stick to Spongebob because Johnny Test is more of a test of patience than anything else
0	The script for Scary Movie just wasn t ready to go This is a problem with the film that is blatantly evident to the actors and the audience alike Director Keenan Ivory Wayans and many of the actors are funny people and so the movie isn t completely humorless To their credit the film has several funny moments But as a whole Scary Movie is not even close to being as clever and amusing as the original The first Scary Movie was a laugh a minute film It turned the smallest subtleties of the slasher film genre into comedic gold The humor in Scary Movie is as heavy handed as it is un original They even miss obvious opportunities for parody Two of the movies stars are former cast members of Beverly Hills and this was a show that was begging to be parodied In the final analysis Scary Movie is like a fine bottle of wine that was opened far too soon The script needed a lot more time to age stars out of
0	Yes he is No not because of Pintilie likes to undress his actors and show publicly their privies Pintilie IS THE naked emperor so to speak It s big time for someone to state the truth This impostor is a voyeur a brat locked in an old man s body His abundance of nude scenes have no artistic legitimacy whatsoever It is visual perversion he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their willies And if he does this in front of the audience he might eve get a hard on Did you know that on the set of Niki Ardelean he used to embarrass poor Coca Bloss by telling her Oh Coca how I wanna f you She is a great lady very decent and sensitive and she became unspeakably ashamed to his petty satisfaction And as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in Romanian audiences so many people are still so foolish to declare these visual obscenities works of art Will anyone have ever the decency to expose the truth of it all
0	This is a movie that relies solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get noticed That is it The dialogs are pathetic and the sensuality of the sex scenes is absolutely absent The acting and the dialog are more suited for high school children yet the subject is intended for adult audiences It is a gutless and shallow movie It could have been way better if it had a story and more drama Ah and on top of that one more thing why are inner monologues so excessively used Makes it seem so cheap All in all an embarrassing movie for Romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences attempting to view it I know the means are scarce but that is not always an excuse for a movie flopping as this one does And please start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from musicians Tudor Chirila they can t act
1	I was pretty young when this came out in the US but I recorded it from TV and watched it over and over again until I had the whole thing memorized To this day I still catch myself quoting it The show itself was hilarious and had many famous characters from Frank Sinatra to Sylvester Stallone to Mr T The voices were great and sounded just like the characters they were portraying The puppets were also well done although a little creepy I was surprised to find out just recently that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor of Red Dwarf a show that I also enjoy very much Like another person had written in a comment earlier I too was robbed of this great show by a friend who borrowed it and never returned it I sure wish there was enough demand for this show to warrant a DVD release but I don t think enough people have heard of it Oh well maybe I ll try e bay
0	As a member of the cast I was a member of the band at all the basketball games I would like to let the world know after being in the movie that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in Oregon This was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the University of Oregon where it was shot Seems that the U of O sign was shown While we were shooting we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff Mr Nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill mannered men I have ever met Quite a time for a young year old BUt certainly not what campus life was really like in the late s and early s despite what Hollywood may think Trombone player from Oregon
1	Not only does this film have one of the great movie titles it sports the third teaming of s child actors Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards I seem to remember this film being broadcast Halloween week back in going against Linda Blair in Stranger in our House I missed it on the first run choosing to see the other film Later on repeat I saw I made the right choice The movie is not really bad but really lacks any chills or surprises Although I did like the scene where Richard Crenna shoots the family dog to no avail
0	they have sex with melons in Asia okay first i doubted that but after seeing the wayward cloud i changed my mind and was finally convinced that they have sex with watermelons with people dead or alive no safe sex of course the terrifyingly ugly leading man shoots it all into the lady s mouth after he did the dead lady never heard of HIV guess not the rest of this movie is mainly boring but also incredibly revolting as a matter of fact in parts it got so disgusting i couldn t take my virgin eyes off sex with dead people how gross is that and what s the message behind it all we need water we need melons we need to be dead to have sex sorry but this stinks
0	My favorite quote from Crow was when the car was going off the cliff The movie is so bad even the car wants to get out of it This had to be the funniest movie I have ever seen It was seriously out there to scare you which makes it even funnier If it weren t for Mystery Science Theater I wouldn t be here today P
0	I m not sure how related they are but I m almost certain that Lost and Delirious is a remake of this movie or the story that it s based on Very similar plotline and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very very similar Lost Delirious is actually a much better movie so see that one instead This one moves very slowly but being a late s French movie that is to be expected of the style Told in a retrospect from the perspective of one of the girls revisiting the school The editing of the flashbacks with the current scenes is a little bit confusing at first particularly since the audio from each overlaps ie hearing flashbacks while seeing the present and vice versa Also the girls are a bit old to think that they are in a boarding school Finally not much character development to even get you attached to the movie
0	I watched this movie recently together with my sister who likes the performances of Sophia Loren I m a person who they call a Cultural Barbarian I hate art in any kind of shape or form Rambo is more my kind of movie action kills blood horror If you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like the plague No one dies no action no nudity nothing of the kind Let me give you a r sum in a few sentences It starts out with minutes in black and white Nazi propaganda Every Italian in a housing block attends a parade in honor of Hitler except for a housewife an anti fascist and a caretaker The housewife who is cheated by her husband meets the anti fascist She falls in love with him wants to make love to him but the anti fascist is gay Despite of this they make love with each other At the end of the day the housewife reads a book from her gay lover and the guy himself is deported by agents The end You want an even shorter r sum BORING That short enough The guy should have used his gun in the beginning of this movie and shoot himself to save the audience from this atrocity On a side note my sister loved this movie Like I said I m a Cultural Barbarian
0	Blazing saddles It s a fight between two estranged brothers Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard both of whom can ignite fires mentally they square off over childhood differences with dippy love interest Debra Winger caught in the middle Director Glenn Gordon Caron the TV whiz kid behind Moonlighting smothers the darkly textured comedy in Vince Gilligan s screenplay with a presentation so slick the movie resembles an entry from an over enthusiastic film student on a fifteen million dollar grant It has the prickly energy of a big commercial feature but a shapeless style which brings out nothing from the characters except their kooky eccentricities These aren t even characters they re plot functions Barely released to theaters the film is a disaster although strictly as an example of style over substance it does look good Winger is the only stand out in a cast which looks truly perplexed from
0	The saddest thing about this tribute is that almost all the singers including the otherwise incredibly talented Nick Cave seem to have missed the whole point where Cohen s intensity lies by delivering his lines in an almost tuneless poise Cohen transmits the full extent of his poetry his irony his all round humanity laughter and tears in one To see some of these singer upstarts make convoluted suffering faces launch their pathetic squeals in the patent effort to scream I m a singer is a true pain It s the same feeling many of you probably had listening in to some horrendous operatic versions of simple songs such as Lennon s Imagine Nothing simply nothing gets close to the simplicity and directness of the original If there is a form of art that doesn t need embellishments it s Cohen s art Embellishments cast it in the street looking like the tasteless make up of sex for sale In this Cohen s tribute I found myself suffering and suffering through pitiful tributes and awful reinterpretations all of them entirely lacking the original irony of the master and if truth be told several of these singers sounded as if they had been recruited at some asylum talent show It s Cohen doing a tribute to them by letting them sing his material really not the other way around they may have been friends or his daughter s he could have become very tender hearted and in the mood for a gift Too bad it didn t stay in the family Fortunately but only at the very end Cohen himself performed his majestic Tower of Song but even that flower was spoiled by the totally incongruous background of the U all of them carrying the expression that bored kids have when they visit their poor grandpa at the nursing home A sad show really and sadder if you truly love Cohen as I do
0	It makes the actors in Hollyoaks look like the Royal Shakespeare Company This movie is jaw dropping in how appalling it is Turning the DVD player off was not a sufficient course of action I want to find the people responsible for this disaster and slap them around the face I will never get that time back Never How is it possible to create such a banal boring and soulless film I could not think of a course of action that would relieve the tedium Writing the required ten lines is incredibly difficult for such a disgraceful piece of cinema What more can you say than reiterate how truly awful the acting is Please avoid
1	I have to say that this TV movie was the work that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart is We are so used to now seeing her in a sitcom and I really hope that a TV station will show this TV movie again soon as it will show the Sabrina fans that MJH shines in a drama Seen as we have watched her on Sabrina now for now years and so to give the viewers a taste of her much unused talent would be a plus Melissa plays her role so well in this wanting her parents done away with so she can be with the guy she loves One thing that all Sabrina viewers will notice Melissa works with David Lascher in this well before he took the role of Josh on Sabrina So it would be kind of neat to see this currently whenever it gets aired again Hopefully MJH gets some good roles in movies or even in more TV Movies sort of like Kellie Martin who has always shined in TV Movies Lots of unused talent waiting to bust out when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart you shine always Melissa
0	They re showing this on some off network It s well crap While it is not as bad as the B movies they show on the Sci fi network on Saturdays but still a fairly large pile of crap The acting is passable The plot and writing are fairly sub standard and the pacing is entirely too slow Every minute of the movie feels like the part of the movie where they re wrapping things up before the credits not the peak of the movie the denouement Also large portions of the cast look way to old for the age range they re playing The whole thing is predictable boring and not worthy of being watched Save your time It s not even worth the time it takes to watch it for free
0	Being a music student myself I thought a movie taking place in a conservatory might be fun to watch Little did I know I had no idea this movie was based on a book by Britney Spears This movie was implausible throughout It s obvious that whoever wrote the script never set foot in a conservatory and doesn t know a thing about classical music Let me give you just a few examples There is NO WAY anyone would be admitted to a classical conservatory with no classical training whatsoever Just having a nice pop voice isn t enough besides that s a different thing altogether another genre different technique It s like playing the violin when applying for a viola class How come the lady teaching music theory was in the singing jury If she wasn t a singing professor herself she would have no say in a situation like that and if she was a singing professor why weren t we told so Being able to read music is a necessity if you re to major in music How did Angela get a hold of that video tape That would have been kept confidential for the jury s eyes only Now either she got the tape from one of the professors or the script writers just didn t have a clue I wonder which The singing professor gave Holly the Carmen song saying she had the range which she clearly did NOT Yes she was able to sing the notes but Carmen is a mezzo soprano while Holly s voice seemed to be much lighter in timbre not at all compatible with that song Worst of all Not only does the movie show a shocking ignorance when it comes to classical music but it doesn t even try to hide it The aria that Angela sings is mutilated beyond recognition a fact which is painfully blatant at the recital where it is cut short in a disgraceful way Mozart would roll over in his grave The Habanera from Carmen sounded a bit weird at times too and the way it was rearranged at the end just shows how little the producers really think of classical music it s stiff and boring but hey add some drums and electric guitars and it s almost as good as Britney Spears I know these are all minor details but it would have been so easy to avoid them with just a little research Anyhow I might have chosen to suspend my disbelief had the characters and the plot been well elaborated But without that I really can t find any redeeming qualities in this movie except for one it s good for a laugh
0	If this is the first of the Nemesis films that you have seen then I strongly urge you to proceed no further The sequels to Nebula prove to be no better hard to believe considering this entry is bottom of the barrel This movie tries but it s just not worth your time folks Take a nap instead
0	I remember my parents not understanding Saturday Night Live when I was They also did not understand Rock n Roll and many other things Now that I am approaching their age I still remember and find I understand many of the things my kids love But this is pathetic I cannot say I have seen any by Sarah except for a few appearances here and there They were reasonable I do not see her as anything special But this show is just so far below what I expected from her The IMDb write up made it sound like potential So just for that I started watching the first episode I turned it off half way through Anything else is better that that Jokes that are meant for a year old presented on a supposed adult program Well Sarah this adult is inly moved to turn you off I just cant believe that someone actually financed this insult to comedy Only good thing I can say is that there are sooooo many bad jokes deposited here saving other shows from such an embarrassment
0	The premise is ridiculous the characters unbelievable the dialogue trite and the ending absurd Believe me I m a fan of Kevin Kline but watching him do a Pepe Le Pew accent for hours as a supposed Frenchman is not nearly as amusing as it sounds For her part Meg Ryan is once again as perky and adorable as a take your pick kewpie doll baby puppy kitten whatever you happen to think is the cutest creature on earth She also bears not the slightest resemblance to a real human being This movie strikes me as an opportunity seized by buddies Lawrence Kasdan and Kline to vacation in Paris and the south of France while being well paid for it So I can t really blame them
1	I only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title It now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films It is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the Maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully It has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world I fell in love with this film and with the characters in it It is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric Beales a true aristocratic family It has a tangible atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could be there away from it all cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table It has an air of sadness that permeates throughout A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family The money had gone but their airs and graces remained as well as their beauty It drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished I found myself wondering about their fate Wondering that if I took a walk along East Hampton beach I might still hear Old Edie s voice in the night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper Unforgettable
1	But the rest of us who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to get you crying enjoy Tom Hulce is magnificent as Dominick a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother Eugene played by Ray Liotta who is a doctor and who works very long hours Due to Eugene s work schedule Dominick is alone a lot of the time and tends to make questionable judgment calls He really just wants to be a good boy to do the right thing and to make his brother proud of him He stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character has you crying before the damn movie even gets really started Not about to give anything away here but the movie is extremely involving and sad and heartbreaking Those unafraid of these things will have a field day with this beautiful story its loving characters and a great song I cannot quote here that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely appropriate but you hear it in a bar I thought Tom Hulce would be nominated for this movie since he was for Amadeus I figured that might give him the inside track to actually winning No such luck Liotta is just as good but has less of an emotional impact but then he does later on All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she doesn t have much of a part here but it was nice of her to lend her name to a small drama set in Pittsburgh about two brothers who you will never forget
0	This is the biggest insult to TMNT ever Fortunantely officially Venus does not exist in canon TMNT There will never be a female turtle this took away from the tragic tale of male unique mutants who will never have a family of their own once gone no more The biggest mistake was crossing over Power Rangers to TMNT with a horrible episode the turtle s voices were WRONG and they all acted out of character They could have done such a better job better designs and animatronics and NO VENUS don t bother with this people it s cringe worthy material the lip flap was slow and unnatural looking they totally disrespected shredder the main baddie some dragonlord dude was corny the turtles looked corny with things hanging off their bodies what s with the thing around raph s thigh the silly looking sculpted plastrons If they looked normal acted in character and got rid of Venus got rid of the stupid kiddie cartoon sounds and better writing it could have been good
0	This is one of the worst movies I have seen this year You should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here there are SPOILERS Gray Matters centers on Gray and Sam Baldwin Heather Graham and Tom Cavanagh Only Gray and Sam are Brother and Sister living together in everyone else s eyes as man and wife No sex but just about everything else Early on the movie starts with its theme the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions Gray and Sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch Rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him she does it and gets to the nitty gritty questions too When she signals her brother to come over they start a way date Charlie Bridget Moynahan is the girl of THEIR dreams like all the right things etc Sam final hits Gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage proposal That Charlie accepts In one week Charlie Gray and Sam are to be in Vegas In the next week Charlie and Gray are off shopping for wedding gowns apparently Charlie has an off the rack figure Gray is slurping an iced latte when Charlie suggests Gray tries on some gowns as well and picks out a frock for her While Charlie is zipping her in this down payment on a house gown Gray continues to slurp on the latte I swear it was like a feed bag What should happen but woops latte all over the gown It is never explained how they got out of Bloomingdale s bridal salon with out a mocha colored gown Back to reality Caesar s palace Las Vegas They have the high roller room Sam is a resident surgeon and Charlie is an intern zoologist were do they get all this money Gray kicks Sam out to the single room down the hall so she and Charlie can have a bachelorette drink a thon were you guessed it they kiss Gray remembers everything Charlie remembers nada They make it to wedding chapel and right when the Reverend gets to his line If there is anybody is here who has any objection whatsoever to the union of these two lovebirds Gray gets the hiccups Gray excuses herself for some reason the Reverend must repeat his last line and right on queue again hiccups Gray gets back to NY and starts dating any man she meets literally And of course one is you guessed it again Gay The other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver Alan Cummings named Gordy He is smittened with Gray but the feelings are not returned They become great friends This is good because when she comes clean with Sam about the kiss He blows up and kicks her out of their apartment When Sam comes to his senses he goes to her office Gray works at an ad agency This office is smack in the middle of the twilight zone It has cameras and microphones in all the conference rooms that broadcast to all computer monitors at the agency Sam gets Gray in one of the conference rooms for a not so private conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office This is where I doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew Gordy comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar Sorry no men says the bouncer So Gray and Gordy return with Gordy in drag Bad drag He was in a sleeveless black satin like blouse a string of pearls and a grandma s church hat No lesbian would ever confuse this man in a dress as a drag queen much less a woman The bar was also the straight man s fantasy of what a lesbian bar is full of Victoria s Secret models Everything turns out peachy she goes home with her firm s client Gray happens to be on the woman s account and finally does more then kiss For some reason no one tells Charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole movie of this kiss with Gray but that is for the sequel
0	The views of Earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by NASA have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of Apollo and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day This would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the whole Earth picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window I am waiting for Bart Sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by NASA though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map and the ones in private hands would still be a problem Ah a response Trying to discredit this movie by referring to NASA weather data I d say is a charming but weak and gullible argument What about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie A certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels Do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here This movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by U S government that the moon missions were a success and that man now are true masters of the universe Things are nearly never quite what they seem Just watch the movie and I dear say you ll see things a bit different than before First off weather data doesn t come from NASA it comes for met agencies around the world Second the weather data undermines a major claim in the film Third far from being packed with irrefutable evidence the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked Sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film so he edited it and added his own interpretation Unfortunately for him his source film is public domain and the bits Sibrel edited out contradict his claims
0	This wasn t what i wanted to see I bought this on DVD and under the movie i found myself irritated and turned off the movie for a moment Heres what i didn t like They were shooting at the father The tribes was really annoying the dinosaurs mostly looked to faked The bad scientist well he was annoying The picture quality on the DVD was really badWhat i DID like The music by Jerry Goldsmith This music is really great I have the bootleg soundtrack from this movie Sadly the sound quality is not good but its OK for its time The first time we see the dinosaurs they inspire a sort of awe Baby is kinda cute when he is in the water and is playing That funny scene with the tent The children who sees this film would hopefully learn that evil always loses
0	This was a movie that I hoped I could suggest to my American friends But after attempts to watch the movie to finish I knew I couldn t even watch the damn thing to close You are almost convinced the actual war didn t even last that long Other s will try to question my patriotism for criticizing a movie like this But flat out you can t go from watching Saving Private Ryan to LOC Forget about the movie budget difference or the audience those don t preclude a director from making an intelligent movie The length of the movie is not so bad and the fact that it is repetitive they keep attacking the same hill but give it different names I thought the LOC was a terrible terrain this hill looked like my backyard The character development sequences the soilders flashbacks looking back to their last moments before being deployed should have been throughout the movie and not just clumped into one long memory To this day I have yet to watch the ending But there was a much better movie not saying much called Border
0	Why was this film made Even keeping in mind the generous tax concessions that Australian film investors were given there can be no reasonable explanation for this film being given the go ahead For goodness sakes the actors cast in this film are Aussie b grade celebs not actors people like John Michael Hollywood Howson the original drummer from the band in Hey Hey Its Saturday and the voice over guy in Countdown But in saying that this is still very watchable as long as you give it the brain attention it deserves none The script is bad even for a self confessed b grade horror and the acting and film quality is worse It often looks as though it is a home movie but even a home movie has realism Anyone interested in Australian cinema please for the love of God pretend this film was NEVER made
0	I got this DVD from a friend who got it from someone else and that probably keeps going on Even the cover of the DVD looks cheap as is the entire movie Gunshots and fist fights with delayed sound effects some of the worst actors I ve seen in my life a very simple plot it made me laugh till my stomach hurt With very few financial resources I must admit it looked pretty professional Seen as a movie it was one of the in a dozen wannabe gangsta flicks nobody s waiting for So if you re tired and want a cheap laugh see this movie If not throw it out of the window
1	Okay This Movie is a Pure Pleasure It has the Ever so Violent Horror Mixed with a Little Suspense and a Lot of Black Comedy The Dentist Really Starts to loose His Mind and It s Enjoyable to Watch him do so This Movie is for Certain People Though Either you ll Completely Love it or You Will Totally Hate It A Good Movie to Rent and Watch When you don t Got Anything else to do Also Recommended Psycho III

1	I just saw this episode this evening on a recently added presentation by one of our local independent channels which now presents two episodes each weekday As the gentleman opined in the other previous comment here I agree this may not have been one of the best programs of the series but I find it entertaining nonetheless My father was a friend of one of the principals in my hometown Cincinnati for whom young Rod Serling had worked in the media there and I remember Dad telling how talented and creative he was remembered there Overall Twilight Zone is certainly one of the true classics in television and given its production during the height of the Cold War period provides not only a view of this era in the country but also today a nostalgic picture of production techniques creative viewpoints and the actors of this era several decades ago Minor spoiler This particular story depicts as did other presentations in this series and elsewhere a story where the locale is meant to provide a surprise ending Sometimes the characters are on earth from elsewhere while the story at first implies at least one is an Earthling These usually contained the message as here of a situation prompted by the doomsday buttons having finally been pressed by the super powers during this Cold War period Viewed today stories like this one provide a nostalgic look at this worldly viewpoint decades ago and still provide some food for thought as did this episode While the dialog may not have stretched the considerable talents of the leads it still presents a simple important message and a worthwhile some minutes of entertainment and interest
1	Meryl Streep was incredible in this film She has an amazing knack for accents and she shows incredible skill in this film overall I really felt for her when Lindy was being persecuted She was played realistically too She got cranky upset and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their unrelenting witchhunt I didn t expect much from the film initially but I really got interested in it and the movie is based on a real person and real events It turned out to be better than I had anticipated Sam Neill was also outstanding this is the best work I ve seen from him and I ve really liked him in other movies The Piano for example I gave the film a but if I could rate just the acting I d give the it a and a perfect for Streep
1	Obviously there wasn t a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production But the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot I mean brutal on the level of Ju Dou and other great Chinese films I first saw this when I was years old I ran home and begged God to forgive me for everything
0	This Movie is complete crap Avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs it is rambling and incoherent I pride myself on plumbing the depths of s sleaze cinema from everything from Salo to Salon Kitty I like being shocked but I need a coherent story However if watching horses mate gets you off this film is for you The saddest part was that lame werewolf suit with the functional wang I mean its just plain hard to sit through not to mention the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is dubbed badly Please I know the cover is interesting what looks like a gorillas hands reaching for a woman s bare ass but don t waste your time or money as you won t get either back
1	De vierde man The Fourth Man is considered one of the best European pycho thrillers of the eighties This last work of Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his home country before he moved to Hollywood to become a big star with movies like Total Recall Basic Instinct and Starship Troopers is about a psychopathic and disillusioned author Jeroen Krabbe going to the seaside for recovering There he meets a mysterious femme fatale Renee Soultendieck and starts a fatal love affair with her He becomes addicted to her with heart and soul and finds out that her three previous husbands all died with mysterious circumstances De vierde man is much influenced by the old Hollywood film noire and the psycho thrillers of Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Wells It takes much time to create a dark and gripping atmosphere and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have the right impact to push the story straight forward The suspense is sometimes nearly unbearable and sometimes reminds of the works of Italian cult director Dario Argento The cast is also outstanding especially Krabbe s performance as mentally disturbed writer that opened the doors for his international film career The Living Daylights The Fugitive If you get the occasion to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on TV video or DVD don t miss it
1	If you were ever sad for not being able to get a movie on DVD it was probably Delirious you were looking for How often do you laugh when watching stand up comedy routines I was too young to see Richard Pryor during his greatest time and when I was old enough to see Eddie Murphy s Delirious and Raw not as funny I never knew where Eddie got a big part of his inspiration Now that I m older and have seen both Pryor and many of the comedians after Murphy I realize two things Everybody STEALS from Eddie while Eddie LOVINGLY BORROWED from Richard That s the huge difference Eddie was original funny provocative thoughtful and more He was something never before seen He was all we ever needed These days Eddie Murphy is boring and old but once upon a time he was The King and Delirious was the greatest castle ever built Truly one of the funniest routines of all time
1	Riding Giants is an amazing movie It really shows how these people lived back then just to surf Their lives were basically surfing living breathing and having fun They didn t care about money jobs girls or any thing To them the waves were their girls I have never been on a surf board and it looks so hard I don t understand how they can stay on them it makes no sense at all This is an awesome movie and if you love surfing then you should really see this movie If you re a surfer and you want to find out who started surfing how it came into life who is really famous at it or what ever then you should really see it It might be a documentary but it is really good Tara F
1	Joan Fontaine here is entirely convincing as an amoral beauty who is entirely incapable of feeling love for anyone but herself Her husband Richard Ney has lost all his money through a combination of his foolhardiness and her extravagance and they are reduced to living in a tiny room with little or no prospects They continue to put on the most amazing clothes and go out and socialize as if nothing were wrong He is a charming feckless but wholly amiable fellow However Fontaine decides he has to go as he has outlived his usefulness So she resolves to poison him when she realizes he does not want to divorce her so that she can move on She has meanwhile had a lover Patric Knowles whom she decides to drop because he is not rich either She meets the aging Herbert Marshall who has a yacht with all the trimmings and more money than even Fontaine could figure out how to spend She targets him and decides he will do nicely He is all too eager to be eaten up by the young beauty He certainly isn t very exciting and has about as much sex appeal as yesterday s omelette But Fontaine is one of those gals who has eyes only for money and the man standing between her and it is transparent so that she doesn t even notice or care what he looks like she looks through him and sees what she really wants and goes for it She proceeds to poison her husband and dispatches him very neatly and satisfactorily so that everything is going well But as always happens in the movies and sometimes even in life some unexpected things begin to go wrong and the tension rises appreciably so that Fontaine begins to sweat Fontaine is particularly good at looking wicked and terrified and as the net begins to close in on her her rising sense of desperation is palpable and has us on the edges of our seats Hysteria and fear take over from cool calculation and cunning But she finds a fall guy for her crime in the person of her cast off lover who is an innocent victim of her scheme to set him up He is condemned to death for murder because the husband s death by poison came to light unexpectedly But Sir Cedric Hardwicke playing a grimly determined Scotland yard inspector thinks there may be something amiss and begins to doubt the story and suspect Fontaine He closes in on her and some of the scenes as this happens are inspired portrayals of the wildest panic But will the innocent man s life be saved before he is executed Will Fontaine worm her way out of this one Will Herbert Marshall protect her to safeguard his infatuation This film is expertly directed by Sam Wood and the film is a really superb suspense thriller which I suppose qualifies very well for the description of a superior film noir
0	Perhaps the biggest waste of production time money and the space on the video store shelf If someone suggests you see this movie run screaming in the other direction Unless of course you re into self abuse
1	One of the most timely and engrossing documentaries you ll ever watch While the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas it provides an intimate look into political dynamics that prevail throughout the western Hemisphere While essentially another chapter in the story of the U S backed Latin American coup this film chronicles in real time what can happen when the poorest people are armed with unity political savvy and courage The political insights offered by this film are invaluable One gets clear examples of the private media as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda We see the poor people of Caracas grappling with the brutal realities of American politics One gets a clear sense of impending doom if the people fail to address the blatant tyranny which has been abruptly and illegally thrust upon them by the conspirators We also see the arrogance and fascism of the CIA backed private media plutocrats and generals who ve conspired to bring Venezuela back under Washington s domination Though ably led by President Hugo Chavez the people of Caracas are forced to act without him after Chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals Their response is the highpoint of the film If one seeks an excellent portrait of what the U S government Hugo Chavez and revolutionary Venezuela are all about this movie is it
1	This happens to be one of my favorite horror films It s a rich classy production boasting an excellent cast of ensemble actors beautiful on location cinematography a haunting musical score an intelligent and novel plot theme and an atmosphere of dread and menace It s reminiscent of such classic films as ROSEMARY S BABY and THE SHINING wherein young vulnerable women find themselves victimized by supernatural forces in old creepy buildings with a macabre past Here CRISTINA RAINES plays a top New York City fashion model named Alison Parker Her happy outgoing exterior masks a deeply conflicted and troubled soul This is evidenced by the revelation that in her past she attempted suicide twice once as a teenage girl after walking in on her degenerate father cavorting in bed with two women and having him rip a silver crucifix from her neck and toss it on the floor and the second time after her married lawyer boyfriend s wife supposedly committed suicide over learning of their affair Telling her beau played by a suitably slimy CHRIS SARANDON that she needs to live on her own for a year or so she answers a newspaper ad for a fully furnished spacious one bedroom apartment in an old Brooklyn Heights brownstone This building actually exists and is located at Montague Terrace right by the Brooklyn Heights Promenade off Remsen Street The producers actually filmed inside the building and its apartments paying the residents for their inconvenience of course The real estate agent a Miss Logan AVA GARDNER seems to be very interested in having Alison take the apartment an interest that cannot be solely explained by the commission she would earn Especially when she quickly drops the rental price from a month to Alison agrees and upon leaving the building with Miss Logan notices an elderly man sitting and apparently staring at her from the top floor window Miss Logan identifies the man to her as Father Halliran and tells Alison that he s blind Alison s response is very logical Blind Then what does he look at After moving in Alison meets some of the other residents in the building including a lesbian couple played by SYLVIA MILES and BEVERLY D ANGELO who provide Alison with an uncomfortable welcome to the building Alison s mental health and physical well being soon start to deteriorate and she is plagued by splitting headaches and fainting spells When she relays her concerns to Miss Logan about her sleep being disturbed on a nightly basis by clanging metal and loud footsteps coming from the apartment directly over her she is dumbstruck to learn that apart from the blind priest and now herself no one has lived in that building for the last three years Summoning the courage one night to confront her nocturnal tormentor she arms herself with a butcher knife and a flashlight and enters the apartment upstairs She is confronted by the cancer riddled specter of her dead father and uses the knife on him in self defense when he comes after her The police investigate and find no sign of violence in that apartment no corpse no blood nothing Yet Alison fled the building and collapsed in the street covered in blood her own as it turns out But there s nary a mark on her What Alison doesn t realize until the film s denouement is that her being in that brownstone has a purpose She was put there for a reason a reason whose origin dates back to the Biblical story of the Garden of Eden and of the angel Uriel who was posted at its entrance to guard it from the Devil She is being unknowingly primed and prepped by the Catholic Church to assume a most important role one that will guarantee that her soul which is damned for her two suicide attempts can be saved At the same time the invisible neighbors who turn out to be more than just quirky oddballs have a different agenda in mind for her This is a competent and intelligently done film and one that surprisingly portrays the Church and its representatives in a mostly sympathetic light
1	This film is one of those nostalgia things with me and I never REALLY expect anyone else to get it but am pleased when I recommend it and somebody DOES enjoy it My late father HATED Arthur Askey but this film was one he really enjoyed and his consistent enthusiasm for The Ghost Train and Old Ted Olmes transferred to me as a child Years later I watch it every now and again enjoying the familiarity I always wonder if it will not be quite the same but I am never disappointed in it There is much to enjoy The sequence on the train is truly inspired when Askey and Murdoch proceed to annoy the arrogant male passenger Then the whole section in the station is amazing with so much going on you have to keep up Yes it is dated and full of wartime Britishness in accents and plot based on the original play by Arnold Ridley of Dad s Army fame but full of wonderful character performances including Kathleen Harrison as a dotty spinster The atmosphere is truly as near sinister as an Arthur Askey vehicle could get This is available cheap as chips in the UK on DVD so treat yourself It is a perfect Saturday Sunday morning or any day lazy afternoon lightweight piece of entertainment I Thank You OLD MOVIES CAN BE GOOD MOVIES
1	Diego Armando Maradona had been sixteen years of age in when Argentina won the World Cup at home He was already the biggest star and the greatest player in a country obsessed with football Everybody had begged Cesar Luis Menotti to play the boy genius but the manager thought that he was not yet ready History records that Argentina won the World Cup fairly convincingly they hadn t really needed Maradona The same was not true in Spain was a catalogue of disaster for Argentina Menotti still chain smoking played Diego this time but the occasion was too much for such a temperamental boy Maradona had signed for Barcelona on June for around million nine days later he played his first game at the Camp Nou and Belgium beat Argentina one nil It was not an auspicious debut and even though he scored twice against Hungary in the next match Maradona will remember the mundial as the site of his nadir a crude petulant foul on Brazil s Batista in the Second Round that abruptly ended his tournament and Argentina s reign as world champions But now that was all behind him Maradona had muddled his way through some crazy times at Barca and left in to join Napoli It was as if he was finally home The Neapolitan tifosi had done everything to entice Maradona to poor underachieving Napoli Gifts from old women and pocket money from young boys nestled uncomfortably with the Camorra s millions as part of the transfer fee and the city was determined to make him feel at home So for the time being at least Maradona was El Rey he brought his Argentine side to Mexico as one of the favourites and with a new manager Carlos Bilardo replacing Menotti Maradona is the hero of this story a one man World Cup winning machine In hundreds of young men had died in a pointless battle for the Falkland Isles now the British press yearned for a rematch with the same result in Mexico City Maradona was still regarded with distinction in England remembered more for a superb performance in Britain during a tour than for Spain But he was still an Argie the enemy England actually started well and Lineker could have scored after only twelve minutes A key event happened on minutes Fenwick the big and limited English defender was booked he was now terrified of making any challenges around the penalty area After a tense first minutes the second half started with a bang Maradona danced forward after minutes but could find no way through Similarly Valdano s attempt hit only white shirts Then the moment of infamy that serves as Diego s epitaph Hodge bizarrely hooked the ball back into his own penalty area Shilton hurriedly jumped to claim but there was Maradona somehow rising above the English goalkeeper to thrust the ball into the net How had he done it Simple handball The most famous foul in football history passed in near slow motion Every spectator waited for Mr Al Sharif of Syria to blow for the foul he didn t Shilton looked and appealed to the linesman he ran back to the centre circle Unless he assassinates the Pope or becomes the first man to step foot on Mars when the great man dies this moment will be shown first in long lingering slow motion followed by the look of glee on his face The next image will be his next gift to the world the World Cup s finest goal Burruchaga stroked the ball to Maradona who was ambling around on the right hand side of his own half He span and accelerated away from Beardsley and Reid This was the real Diego he burst through Butcher and attacked Fenwick Fenwick now had the opportunity to stop the attack Normally he would have aimed his boot somewhere near Maradona s thigh sure he would have picked up a red card but who cares Then Fenwick had a brainwave he hesitated and decided to run at Maradona waving his arms perhaps he was trying to put him off Diego shot into the box as Fenwick fell over Butcher had been running alongside the genius as if he was offering encouragement Shilton charged out in panic and Maradona twisted around him and prepared to score Now Butcher remembered his role and tried to cripple the Argentinean instead he gave extra impetus to the shot which smashed into the goal England were coming home During this magical Mexican summer the world had found a successor for Pele In fact the greatest ever footballer had been surpassed Pele had been superb in and but had had great players all around him Maradona did not was his World Cup
0	This film is too skeletal It s a fairly low budget film I hope which excuses it somewhat but the lack of a decent cast and a fleshed out plot hurts it too much Phillips is quite believable in his role as a torn apart son of a well off family who s searching for himself though his family is er well a little too white but the rest of the cast is grasping at straws Every moment that has potential is ruined by excessive melodrama and there are way too many sub plots which is an obvious sign of plot deficiency They needed filler I wouldn t recommend this film to anyone who isn t either a hard core Phillips fan or who has absolutely nothing to do
1	Another powerful chick flick This time it revolves around Diana Gusman who is always getting into fights at school Instead of getting expelled she takes her anger elsewhere to the boxing ring She trains to be a boxer and there she meets featherweight Adrian and begins to fall in love with him This movie has a powerful message of taking your dreams and going with them even if someone doesn t believe in you in this case her dad doesn t believe in her That alone makes the movie worth the price Enjoy
1	I think the deal with this movie is that it has about minutes of really really funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and a lot of people came in with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie doesn t live up to the trailer It s a little more sluggish and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise and i think i m seeing from the comments people having a love hate relationship with this movie However if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it could have been considering the talent of the cast i think it s still pretty good Julia Stiles is clearly the star she s so giddy and carefree that set among the conformity of everyone else she just glows and the whole audience falls in love with her along with Lee The rest of the cast of course Lee s testosterone filled coworkers his elegant mother in law his fratlike friend Jim and his bride to be all do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of conformity and boringness that make Stiles stand out in the first place Lee doesn t live up to his costars i don t think but you could view that as more that they re hard to live up to Maybe that s one source of disappointment The movie itself despite a bit of slowness and a few jokes that don t come off as funny as the writer s intended is still pretty funny and I found a rather intelligent film The themes of conformity and taking the safe route seemed to cleverly align on several layers For example there was the whole motif of how he would imagine scenarios but would never act on them until the last scene or how he was listening to a radio program on the highway talking about how everyone conforms or just how everything selma blair and julia stiles characters said and did was echoed by those themes of one person being the safe choice and one being the risky choice The other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which Jason Lee has to keep lying his way through the movie and who through dumb luck example the pharmacy guy turning out to be a good chef and some cleverness on his part gets away with it for the most part While it wasn t as funny as i expected and there was a little bit of squandered talent but overall it s still a good movie
0	What was the worst movie of Cat in the Hat Gigli Mais non I propose that it was this atrocious little film from earlier in the year Badly written badly edited and if I may be so bold badly acted The Order is the black hole of film a movie so dense not even the slightest bit of entertainment could escape from its event horizon of suck It isn t even accidentally funny like for example Showgirls You know that the producers are assuming that their audience isn t going to be very smart They renamed the movie originally titled The Sin Eaters because they figured Americans were too stupid to understand what a sin eater was even though they go to great lengths to explain what a sin eater is in the movie Instead they figure an utterly generic title and a picture of Heath Ledger looking sullen are more than enough to get you in there And hey what do you know they were right My ex girlfriend saw the picture of Heath and dragged me in Congratulations producers you ve met your target market She also liked Grease II so you re in good company Back on topic Heath plays a Catholic monk from a specific you guessed it order that is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor He has celibacy issues possibly because nobody in their right mind would believe that he knew the slightest thing about religion much less be a celibate monk The only other member of this order is a funny alcoholic fat guy As much as I ve wanted to see the return of the funny alcoholic to the big screen his attempts at humor reminded me of all the dorks in my high school who did imitations of Monty Python thinking that if they just said the lines like the Pythons did they would automatically be funny You know the sort of people I m talking about If I utter any more I would be in danger of generating spoilers Frankly the thing that spoiled this movie for me was the fact that it was created
0	That might be a bit harsh for me saying that but sadly so far in his directing career its true Just have a look at what he as done so far They barely make it past the star mark Why did I watch this movie reasons Lucy Lawless and Heroes star Greg Grunberg Lucy was outstanding in this movie her performance carries the whole movie I do hope she gets a blockbuster and breaks into the bigger league of actors she clearly has the skills Greg was not so impressive typical TV acting style The movie is oddly categorized as a horror The only horror is short flashbacks and they last a max of seconds with a little blood in them I personally would call this more a drama thriller But no matter how interesting the story actually is bad directing editing and acting appart from Lucy destroys it You get no real connection to the actors something which is very important in a story like this one You just sit there watching feeling nothing Its like watching a bad TV soap actually I think the TV soap would be more interesting My advice Stay away from this movie or better yet just stay away from anything Michael Hurst is involved with
1	Having just watched this film again from a showing off VH I just had to comment The first time I saw this film on TV it was about and I remember taping it off of my mother s betamax It wound up taping in black and white for some reason which gave it a period look that I grew to like I remember very distinctively the film beginning with the song My Bonnie as the camera panned over a scene of Liverpool I also remember the opening scene where Paul gestures to some girls and says Look talent So it was with great irritation that I popped in my taped version and remembered that the film opens with She Loves You instead of My Bonnie When you see how slowly the camera pans vs the speed of the music you can see that She Loves You just doesn t fit Also in this later version when Paul sees the girls he says Look GIRLS and somehow having remembered the earlier version THAT word just didn t seem to fit either Why they felt they had to Americanize this film for American audiences is beyond me Personally if I m going to watch a film about a British band I want all of the British colloquialisms and such that would be a part of their speech mannerisms etc Another irritation was how choppy the editing was for television Just after Stu gets beaten for example the film cuts to a commercial break LOTS of em Yeah I know it depends on the network but it really ruins the effect of a film to have it sliced apart as we all know What some people might find as insignificant in terms of dialogue and thereby okay to edit may actually go the way of explaining a particular action or scene that follows My point is the best version of this film was probably the earlier version I taped from which just so happened to include the Shake Rattle Roll scene that my version didn t I started to surmise that there had to have been two different versions made for television and a look at the alternate versions link regarding this film proved me right That the American version had some shorter cut different scenes and or dialogue is a huge disappointment to me and something worth mentioning if one cares about such things Imo ones best bet is to try and get a hold of the European version of this film if possible and probably even less possible an unedited version Sadly I had to discard my old betamax European version because I didn t know how to convert it All that aside I found this film to be perhaps one of the best films regarding the story behind the birth of the Beatles Being well aware that artistic and creative license is often used in movies and TV when portraying events in history I didn t let any discrepancies mar my enjoyment of the film Sure you see the Beatles perform songs at the Cavern that made me wonder Did they even write that back then I don t think so but nevertheless I thought it was a great film and the performances wonderful The real stand out for me in fact was the actor who played John Stephen MacKenna I just about fell in love with him His look mannerisms personality and speaking voice seemed to be spot on He looked enough like a young John for me to do a double take towards the end of the film when you see the Beatles performing on Ed Sullivan for the first time I actually found myself questioning whether or not it was actual Beatle footage until I saw the other actors in the scene If you re looking for a dead accurate history of The Beatles life and beginnings you can t get any better than The Beatles Anthology as it was written by the boys themselves However if you re looking for a fun snapshot of their pre Beatlemania days leading up to their arrival in America and you leave your anal critical assessments at the door you can t go wrong with the Birth of the Beatles a MUST for any real or casual Beatle fan
1	From the beginning of the show Carmen was there She was one of the best characters Why did they get rid of her The show not the same as before Its way worse The best episodes were with Carmen in them You can t replace someone from the beginning That is like South Park without Kyle or Child s Play without Chucky It s not right The niece who replaced her is just ugh Awful She doesn t fit into the storyline at all She was one of the main characters and the niece can t replace her She was an awesome actress Way better than the niece Get her back or you ll lose a TON of viewers
0	The plot was dull the girls were sickening and the supposed Italian male lead had clearly never heard an Italian accent Someone said the boys were cute in this film but it just seemed to be filled with mediocre people There were literally no redeeming features about this film I think this is a graveyard for actors that will never work again with the unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for no discernible reason I hope the Olsen twins find something out of the limelight to keep them away from the entertainment business They have no place in it
1	This is one of those unique horror films that requires a much more mature understanding of the word horror in order for it to be appreciated The main thing people may fail to realize that this story is told through the point of view a little boy and as with most younger children he gets frightened easily Mainly because he simply doesn t understand things like why his father is hardly ever there for him From watching the film you can see the husband arguing with his wife the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it but the little boy doesn t Also one can imagine the boy being afraid of the woods as it is established early on in the film that the family is from the city Also in the beginning as the family is traveling to the house they hit a deer then get held up then they argue with the locals about it and the little boy surely didn t find this introduction to the woods pleasant at all The Wendigo is ultimately what his young innocent mind fabricates to explain all of this There is the American Indian legend but when looking at the scene where the young boy hears about about it it is explained to him like bluntly and simplistically Not because that s what the Wendigo actually is but because that is how he understands it When you look at the film from this point of view you can really begin to appreciate it Obviously it was low budget and shot cheaply but the jumping montages use of light and general eeriness more than make up for it And the final question the film asks is is it all in your head or is it really out there Rated R profanity violence and a sex scene
0	St Elmo s Fire has no bearing on life after university at all for the majority of us common folk anyway Why was this garbage even made Who can really relate to this Who lives like these characters I truly feel sorry for the actors having to deal with such a terrible script There are some talented young actors in this film that have done a good job elsewhere It must have just been one whole joke to them on set I actually found this film insulting to my intelligence The only joy I got from this is hoping that Sir John Hughes had a good ol laugh when he saw a screening of this the same year his masterpiece of The Breakfast Club was released Don t make the same mistake I did of watching this because you enjoy s films It really is that offensive to the genre
0	The animation in this re imagining of Peter the Wolf is excellent but at minutes the film is sleep inducing They should have called it Peter the Snails because everything moves at a snail s pace I couldn t even watch the film in one sitting I had to watch it minutes at a time and it was pure torture Save yourself minutes do not watch this film and you will thank me I can only guess that the Oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees Unfortunately to vote for the winner in the Best Animated Short short category the voters will have to sit through the whole thing I already feel sorry for them and must predict that there s no way this film will come close to winning
1	YETI deserves the star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made I saw it at a midnight screening in L A and people were roaring and cheering at the insanity this movie is one of those cinematic trainwrecks where you think it cant get any stranger and THEN IT DOES The millionaire who funds the project to thaw the Yeti looks like Chris Penn and John Goodman both poured into an ill fitting suit the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors to ever appear on screen and yes there is a mute boy who sorta kinda looks like a girl and he s mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents hmmm maybe therapy for the kid Then this hottie Italian girl is seen by Yeti once he thaws which takes FOREVER and he is instantly in love with her what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant Yeti makes bedroom eyes at her it s like a large Barry White trying to seduce a groupie In fact once the large Yeti picks up the hottie and has her against his chest she accidentally touches the Yeti s nipple and yes the film takes the time to show his large grey nipple GET HARD Yikes of all YIKES Plus there s a collie dog in it because the Italian producer must have heard that American audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a Lassie there s also this insane scene where the Yeti eats a giant fish keeps the large fishbone and uses it to comb the Italian girl s hair Gee thanks Yeti now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout You re the best This film is more bizarre than something Ed Wood could have ever dreamt up If you are a fan of classic cinema crap seek this baby out
1	Yes this production is long good news for Bronte fans and it has a somewhat dated feel but both the casting and acting are so brilliant that you won t want to watch any other versions Timothy Dalton IS Edward Rochester it s that simple I don t care that other reviewers claim he s too handsome Dalton is attractive certainly but no pretty boy In fact he possesses a craggy angular dark charm that in my mind is quite in keeping with the mysterious very masculine Mr R And he takes on Rochester s sad tortured persona so poignantly He portrays ferocity when the scene calls for it but also displays Rochester s tender passionate emotional side as well IMO the newer A E production suffers in that Ciaran Hinds whom I normally adore seems to bluster and bully his way throughout I ve read the book many times and I never felt that Rochester was meant to be perceived as a nonstop snarling beast When I reread the novel I always see Zelah Clarke as Jane Ms Clarke to me resembles Jane as she describes herself and is described by others Small childlike fairy though it s true the actress doesn t look she portrays Jane s attributes so well While other reviews have claimed that her acting is wooden or unemotional one must remember that the character spent years at Lowood being trained to hold her emotions and passionate nature in check Her main inspiration was her childhood friend Helen who was the picture of demure submission Although her true nature was dissimilar Jane learned to master her temper and appear docile in keeping with the school s aims for its charity students who would go into service Jane becomes a governess in the household of the rich Mr Rochester She would certainly not speak to him as an equal Even later on when she gave as well as she got she would always be sure to remember that her station was well below that of her employer Nevertheless if you read the book to which this production stays amazingly close you can clearly see the small struggles Zelah as Jane endures as she subdues her emotions in order to remain mild and even tempered The chemistry between Dalton and Clarke is just right I think No it does not in the least resemble Hollywood thank God It s not a Hollywood sort of book but theirs is a romance which is true devoted and loyal And for a woman like Jane who never presumed to have any love come her way it is a minor miracle The rest of the casting is terrific and I love the fact that nearly every character from the book is present here So too is much of the rich poetic original dialogue This version is the only one that I know of to include the lovely infamous gypsy scene and in general features more humor than other versions I ve seen In particular the mutual teasing between the lead characters comes straight from the book and is so delightful Jane Eyre was in many ways one of the first novelized feminists She finally accepted love on her own terms and independently and at last as Rochester s true equal Just beautiful
1	This was a wonderful little American propaganda film that is both highly creative AND openly discusses the Nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed While late and into would reveal just how evil and horrific they were this film unlike other Hollywood films to date is the most brutally honest film of the era I have seen regarding Nazi atrocities The film begins in a courtroom in the future after the war is over the film was made in the war ended in May In this fictitious world court a Nazi leader is being tried for war crimes Wilhelm Grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal Grimm s life since in a series of flashbacks At first it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how Grimm was pushed to join the Nazis However after a while it becomes very apparent that Grimm is just a sadistic monster These episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama All in all the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second tier actors There are many compelling scenes and performances especially the very prescient Jewish extermination scene towards the end that can t help but bring you close to tears It was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first Overall it s a must see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film FYI This is not meant as a serious criticism of the film but Hitler was referred to as that paper hanger This is a reference to the myth that Hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper This is in fact NOT true previously he d been a starving artist homeless person and served well in the German army in WWI A horrible person yes but never a paper hanger
1	Why can t more directors these days create horror movies like The Shining There s an easy answer to that modern day directors are not Stanley Kubrick Kubrick proved once and for all with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and auteurs of all time So the plot is fairly simple A man named Jack Torrance played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson and his family move into a large secluded hotel to watch over it for the off season The kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered his wife and two girls What follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie but you have to watch it to see what I mean This is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as scary It s some seriously messed up stuff but in a good way One of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music Music has been a major part of Kubrick s movies A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange just to name a couple and he definitely doesn t disappoint with this one The score completely sets the tone and this film would not be the same without it Finally I must comment on Nicholson s legendary performance Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer In fact just his stare steals a few scenes of this movie This is top notch acting that must be seen to believe There will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one R I P Stanley
1	This movie is a Gem because it moves with soft but firm resolution I caution viewers that although it is billed as a Corporate Spy thriller and Ms Liu is there it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace It s NOT about explosions car chases or flying bullets You must be patient and instead note the details here It s sedate because that s what the Main Character is The viewer has to WATCH him and Think as this story unfolds I will not give spoilers because that destroys the point of watching The plot is what you ve read from the other postings an average white collar guy seeking change and adventure signs on for a corporate spy job Just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data Take it from there This movie starts at a surreal walk with a background tang of corporate disillusionment that entwines itself with quintessential underlying suburban paranoia Then it begins to accelerate The acting on all parts is superb and yes some of the acts are caricature characters But they all fit and they entertain And the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft soft key sinister theme All is not right at the beginning And at the end All is not what it seems Get comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one and turn up the sound This movie wants you to LISTEN
1	This movie didn t really surprise me as such it just got better and better I thought Paul Rieser wrote this huh Well we ll see how he does Then I saw Peter Falk was in it I appreciate Colombo Even though I was never a big fan of the show I ve always liked watching Peter Falk The performances of Peter and Paul were so natural that I felt like a fly on the wall They played off of each other so well that I practically felt giddy with enjoyment And I hadn t even been drinking This movie was so well done that I wanted to get right on the phone to Paul and let him know how much I enjoyed it but I couldn t find his number Must be unlisted or something This was one of those movies that I had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything It just came on and I thought Eh why not Let s see If I don t like it I don t have to watch it and I ended up just loving it
1	Fido is to be commended for taking a tired genre zombies and turning it into a most original film experience The early s atmosphere is stunning the acting terrific and the entire production shows a lot of careful planning Suddenly the viewer is immersed in a world of beautiful classic cars Eisenhower era dress art deco furniture and zombie servants It would be very easy to dismiss Fido as cartoon like fluff similar to Tank Girl but the two movies are vastly different Fido has structure a script that tells a story and acting that is superior Make no mistake this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed Highly recommended MERK
0	Oh a vaguely once famous actress in a film where she plays a mother to a child It s being shown on BBC at half past midnight I wonder if yup it s a TVM You ve got to hand it to TVM producers not content on making one mediocre movie they usually give us two mediocre movies where two themes are mixed together and NOWHERE TO HIDE is no different The first theme is a woman in danger theme cross pollinated with a woman suffering from the pain of a divorce theme which means we have a scene of the heroine surviving a murder attempt followed by a scene having her son Sam ask why she divorced And being a TVM she answers that the reason is That people change rather than say something along the lines like I m a right slapper or Your daddy cruises mens public toilets for sex as does happen in real life divorce cases And it s young Sam I feel sorry for not only are his parents divorced but he s as thick as two short planks Actually since he s so stupid he deserves no sympathy because he s unaware that a man flushing stuff down a toilet is a drug dealer unaware that you might die if someone shoots at you and unaware that I LOVE LUCY is painfully unfunny If only our own childhoods were so innocent ah well as Orwell said Ignorance is strength Oh hold on Sam is suddenly an expert on marine life Is this character development or poor scripting I know what one my money s on And strange that Sam the boy genuis hasn t noticed that if the story is set in then why do people often wear clothes drive cars and ride trains from the s But as it turns out during a plot twist it s the mother who s the dummy Then there s a final plot twist that left me feeling like an idiot for watching this
0	Must confess to having seen a few howlers in my time but this one is up there with the worst of them Plot troubling to follow Sex and violence thrown in to disorient and distract from the really poorly put together film I can only imagine that the cast will look back on the end product and wish it to gather dust on a shelf not to be disturbed for a generation or two Sadly in my case I have the DVD It will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time
0	A Christmas Story Is A Holiday Classic And My Favorite Movie So Naturally I Was Elated When This Movie Came Out In I Saw It Opening Day and Was Prepared To Enjoy Myself I Came Away Revolted And Digusted The Anticipation that Rang True In A Christmas Story Is Curiously Missing from This mess A Red Ryder BB Gun Is Better to get than a chinese top And It Is Not Very Funny At all Charles Grodin Is Good but the Buck Stops There Bottom Line Star Don t Even Bother
0	Near the closing stages of Baby Mama one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it was all just a mess I really couldn t say it any better than that And while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyone s time A lacklustre cast mundane script and vague caricature characters ensure that Baby Mama certainly isn t taxing on the ol noggin but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour Consisting mainly of very routine clich jokes based around an odd couple rich and poor trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic As a story on finding love it s not that bad but playing this plot line as a side story of sorts to work alongside the comedy orientated odd couple tangent characterisation is notably weak resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles As characters themselves both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness so while we may eventually come to find the character s interactions with each other amusing at times the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles we don t feel for the characters and don t find them inherently interesting but rather their dynamic Unfortunately however although this dynamic works best or at least better than the individual personas as mentioned above it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd couple formula Kate Tina Fey is a successful business woman who has hired working class dumb blonde Angie Amy Poehler to be her unlikely surrogate and after Angie decides to leave hopeless husband Carl Dax Shepard both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences Yes it s the typical odd couple premise and one that we have already seen in this year s What Happens in Vegas yet what Baby Mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi layered characters Kate and Angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air In fact the movie s only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of Romany Malco who gets lumbered with playing a door man Of the few times that I laughed during Baby Mama most of those moments were because of this man and the remainder usually fell to Shepard It s a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its script s themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera and yet director Michael McCullers goes from page to screen effectively enough Yet for a film about babies multi million dollar business and cultural stereotyping this isn t necessarily a good thing Baby Mama is grade A hammy plastic tinsel town with capital bore topped with sugar So not only did I feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two dimensional nature but I simply didn t care for the world they inhabited The dialogue along with sets costumes and the script s general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director s incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy these aren t characters and that isn t our world in any way so why should I care At the end of the day however a romantic comedy s ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests and the frequency of its laughs Baby Mama has little going on in any of these departments Of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair I m sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character Kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored In this respect Baby Mama avoids being unbearable but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch Baby Mama is too light headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining A review by Jamie Robert Ward http www invocus net
1	I think this movie is a very funny film and one of the best National Lampoon s films it also has a very catchy spoof title which basically sums up what the whole movie is about Men In White The story is a spoof of many films including a Will Smith film as you might have guessed Men In Black I will not give the ending away but it has a very good ending in is very funny Leslie Nielsen style humour from start to finish especially the bit near the beginning when thy are in the street collecting the dustbins Garbage Cans Also they have a pretty cool dustbin lorry Garbage Collecting Truck in that scene too The acting is not superb actually it is not very good but that is what makes the film funny it is a comedy loosen up I love the story line partly because it is so far fetched and partly because it is interesting to see how subtle Or should it be Un subtle they rip off all the other films I am great fan of un serious spoof films but i am also a fan of the real thing and with this films it is hard to decide which is better the film it mainly rips off mentioned earlier i this review or the actual film it is but also when you are actually making a spoof of comedy films it actually makes it even harder but this film carries it off successfully The two garbage men are so funny it reminds me of a TV sketch show in the UK called Little Britain This film is a must for your collection and is one of the best most entertaining funniest best storyline National Lampoon s film to date
1	For a no budget movie this thing rocks I don t know if America s gonna like it but we were laughing all the way through Some really Funny Funny stuff Really non Hollywood The Actors and Music rocked The cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up Whooo Whooo I ve seen some of the actors before but never in anything like this one or two of them I think I ve seen in commercials or in something somewhere Basically it Rocked Luckily I got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors
0	The storyline is absurd and lame also sucking are performances and the dialogue is hard to keep your Eyes open I advise you to have a caffeine propelled friend handy to wake you in time for a couple Gore effects Why they bring Alcatraz in In this case becomes increasingly difficult to swallow All the while i wondered who this film aimed for Chock full of lame subplots such as the Cannibalism US Army captain This is low grade in every aspect BTW this Movie is banned in Germany
0	This is a terrible production of Bartleby though not as the other reviewer put it because it is unfilmable but rather because this version does not maintain the spirit of the book It tells the story almost painfully so Watching it I could turn the pages in my book and follow along which is not as much fun when dealing with an adaptation Rather see the version of Bartleby featuring Crispin Glover That version while humorous brings new details to the film while maintaining the spirit of the novel What s important is the spirit not the minutiae of things like setting character names and costumes The difference between these film versions is like night and day tedious and hilarious This version is a lesson as to what can go wrong if an adaptation is handled poorly painful mind numbing schlock
0	I very nearly walked out but I d paid my money and my nearly as disgusted friend wanted to hold out After the endearing wide eyed innocence of A New Hope and the thrilling sophistication of The Empire Strikes Back I remember awaiting Return of the Jedi with almost aching anticipation But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage I was bitterly disappointed and enraged at Lucas He should have been ashamed of himself but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn t have subatomic particle of shame in his cold greedy heart Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact your honor I call Jarjar Binks but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first From the initial raising of the gate at Jabba s lair this film was nothing more than a two plus hour commercial for as many licensable profit making action figures as Lucas could cram into it the pig like guards the hokey flesh pigtailed flunky that vile muppet pet of Jabba s the new and recycled cabaret figures the monsters etc etc ad vomitum Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens Fifteen seconds each on screen or less and the kiddies just GOTTA have one for their collection The blatant exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating Lucas didn t even bother to come up with a new plot he just exhumed the Death Star from A New Hope and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment What an appalling slap in the face to his fans I can t shake the notion that Lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans I ve got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking putrid garbage that I could dream up and they ll flock to the theaters to scarf it up Plus all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in and I get a cut from every single one It ll make me even more obscenely rich There may have been a paltry partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip off I seem to recall that Harrison Ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool But whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that Lucas so avariciously embraced in this total absolute sell out to profit
0	Unusual Yes Unusual setting for an American wartime movie New Zealand Unusual subject matter four sisters and their relationships with American soldiers from one bearing the illegitimate child of the dead son of a Senator to another living with seven Marines one at a time before being murdered by her returning POW New Zealander husband Unusual to see Paul Newman deliver such a poor performance so soon after his unforgettable role as Rocky Graziano in the brilliant Somebody Up There Loves Me Unusual for two fine Stars Joan Fontaine and Jean Simmons to leave so little of themselves on a movie Unusual that I could be bothered to write a review of such a poor film give it a miss
0	This bogus journey never comes close to matching the wit and craziness of the excellent adventure these guys took in their first movie This installment tries to veer away from its prequel to capture some new blood out of the joke but it takes a wrong turn and journeys nowhere interesting or funny There s almost a half hour wasted on showing the guys doing a rock concert and lots of people watching on free TV since when does that happen Surely the script writer could have done something more creative look at how all the random elements of the first movie were neatly tied up together by a converging them at the science presentation Not in this film which pretty much ended the Bill Ted franchise The joke was over The Grim Reaper is tossed into the mix for whatever reason This infusion like the whole plot is done poorly and lacks sparks for comedy or audience involvement There s a ZZ Top impression hammered in for no reason There s lights smoke mirrors noise But nothing really creative or funny Skip this bogus thing

0	Do not waste your time or your money on this movie My roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called Descent the flick about some travelers who get trapped in a cave so we decided to watch it anyways thinking it couldn t be that bad It was I can t believe this movie was actually produced and put out to the public It was so horrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you just can t make yourself I honestly feel emotionally scarred It went from being a semi low budget movie in which a college girl gets assaulted by a boy she s dating to an all out porno flick And really not a good one I went from hating the woman s rapist to almost feeling bad for him Almost All in all an awful movie that was definitely rated NC for a reason Don t waste your money And don t let your kids watch it
1	I wanted to see Valentine ever since I saw that Denise Richards and Marley Shelton were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever When I watched Valentine I was amazed at how great the story line actually was It kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all The actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning Some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor and I admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring but overall it was non stop entertaining and suspenseful It had a mind twisting story line which made you guess the whole way through and it doesn t deserve all the crap it gets I recommend this movie to watch anytime but especially on Valentine s Day because it s sure to give you a ton of chills Oh and don t even pay attention to the trailer OR rating please DON T
1	Please see also my comment on Die Nibelungen part Siegfried The second part of UFA studio s gargantuan production of the Nibelungen saga continues in the stylised symphonic and emotionally detached manner of its predecessor However whereas part one was a passionless portrayal of individual acts of heroism part two is a chaotic depiction of bloodletting on a grand scale As in part one director Fritz Lang maintains a continuous dynamic rhythm with the pace of the action and the complexity of the shot composition rising and falling smoothly as the tone of each scene demands These pictures should only be watched with the note perfect Gottfried Huppertz score which fortunately is on the Kino DVD Now with this focus on mass action Lang is presented with greater challenges in staging The action sequences in his earliest features were often badly constructed but now he simply makes them part of that rhythmic flow with the level of activity on the screen swelling up like an orchestra But just as part one made us witness Siegfried s adventures matter of factly and without excitement part two presents warfare as devastating tragedy In both pictures there is a deliberate lack of emotional connection with the characters That s why Lang mostly keeps the camera outside of the action never allowing us to feel as if we are there and this is significant because involving the audience is normally a distinction of Lang s work That s also why the performances are unnaturally theatrical with the actors lurching around like constipated sleepwalkers Nevertheless Kriemhild s revenge does constantly deal with emotions and is in fact profoundly humanist The one moment of naturalism is when Atilla holds his baby son for the first time and Lang actually emphasises the tenderness of this scene by building up to it with the wild frantic ride of the huns The point is that Lang never manipulates us into taking sides and in that respect this version has more in common with the original saga than the Wagner opera The climactic slaughter is the very antithesis of a rousing battle scene Why then did Hitler and co get so teary eyed over it a fact which has unfairly tarnished the reputation of these films Because the unwavering racial ideology of the Nazis made them automatically view the Nibelungs as the good guys even if they do kill babies and betray their own kin For Hitler their downfall would always be a nationalist tragedy not a human one But for us non nazi viewers what makes this picture enjoyable is its beautiful sense of pageantry and musical rhythm When you see these fully developed silent pictures of Lang s it makes you realise how much he was wasted in Hollywood Rather than saddling him with low budget potboilers they should have put him to work on a few of those sword and sandal epics pictures that do not have to be believable and do not have to move us emotionally where it s the poetic operatic tonality that sweeps us along
1	This is a really funny film especially the second third and fourth time you watch it It s a pretty short film and i definitely recommend watching it more than once you will get it more the second time It s like spinal tap but the rap version It has a lot of attitude in it which can be a negative thing in rap influenced films but it s just a total p s take and isn t a problem because of the irony it creates Plenty of stand out bits one of those types of films which you will find yourself quoting lines with your mates and it WILL raise laughter My personal favourite part is the guerrillas in the midst section Great video superb
0	Final Score out of After seeing Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back I must have been on a big Eliza Dushku kick when I rented this movie Soul Survivors is a junk psychological thriller dressed up like a trashy teen slasher flick even to the point of having a masked killer stalk a cast of young up and comers like Dushku Wes Bentley American Beauty Casey Affleck Drowning Mona and likable star Melissa Sagemiller Luke Wilson is also in there ridiculously miscast as a priest The movie the brainchild of writer director Stephen Carpenter seems like a mutant offspring of Open Your Eyes or Vanilla Sky and movies where a character and the audience is caught in a world of dillusion caused by an accident death The movie keeps churning out perplexing images and leaves us in a state of confusion the entire running time until this alternate reality is finally resolved I don t think these movies are that entertaining by their very nature to begin with but SS is rock bottom cheap trash cinema any way you slice it The visuals the script the acting and the attempt at any originality all are throwaway afterthoughts to movies like this Plus it s PG so it doesn t even deliver the gore or T A to sustain it as a guilty pleasure even the unrated version is tame I had heard that the movie contained some hot shower scene between Dushku Sagemiller As the movie fell apart in front of me and all other entertainment seemed to be lost I found myself waiting patiently for the shower scene at least I would get something out of this Then it comes the two girls get paint on their shirts they jump in the shower fully clothed and scrub it off That s it People thought this was hot Soul Survivors is one of those drop dead boring movies that is so weak and inept that it is hard to have ANY feelings at all toward it It puts out nothing and is hardly worth writing about In the end it leaves us empty Carpenter s finale is a mess of flashing light and pounding sound and that s probably the most lively part It will no doubt be making the rounds as a late night staple on USA or the Sci Fi Channel due to it s low cost and PG rating and that s probably best for it
1	I had a vague idea of who Bettie Page was partly due to her appearance in the very wee days of Playboy apparently when she got her photo taken of her and her Santa hat just that she didn t know what the mag was The movie co written and directed by American Psycho s Mary Harron fleshes out the key parts of her life well enough A southern belle of a church goer has some bad experiences and leaves them behind to seek better times in New York City where she gets into modeling and from there a lot more Soon she becomes the underground pin up sensation with bondage the obvious and notorious of the title trait attributed to her The actress Gretchen Moll portrays her and gets down the spirit of this woman about as well as she could which is really a lot of the success of the film She s not a simplistic character even if at times her ideas of morality are questionable well Adam and Eve were naked weren t they she comments a couple of times Apparently the filmmakers leave out the later years of Page s life and leave off with her in a kind of redemptive period leaving behind the photo shoots for Jesus In all the Notrious Bettie Page is not much more than a kind of usual bio pic presented by HBO films albeit this time with the stamina for a feature film release The best scenes that Harron captures are Page in her questionable positions getting photos of her in over the top poses and starring in ridiculous films of whips and chains and leather uniforms This adds a much needed comic relief to the film s otherwise usual nature It s not that the story behind it is uninteresting which involves the government s investigation into the smut that came out of such photos and underground magazines But there isn t much time given to explore more of what is merely hinted at with Page and her complexities or her relationships or to sex and the fifties It s all given a really neat black and white look and sometimes it seemed as if Harron was progressing some of the black and white photos to be tinted more as it went along It s a watchable view if you re not too knowledgeable of Bette Page and probably for fans too
1	A classic cartoon always enjoyable and funny It has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters Road Rovers is a show worth seeing it is a short episodes and if you can ever manage a chance to see it you should Unfortunately it is very hard to find I think Warner Brothers Studios should release a DVD that contains all episodes I would definitely buy it if they did and if they do you should buy it too if you have kids who like dogs they will love road rovers Road Rovers should have gotten more attention while it was being aired it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was
1	Theodore Rex is possibly the greatest cinematic experience of all time and is certainly a milestone in human culture civilization and artistic expression In this compelling intellectual masterpiece Jonathan R Betuel aligns himself with the great film makers of the th century such as Francis Ford Copola Martin Scorcese Orson Welles and Roman Polanski The special effects are nothing less than breathtaking and make any work by Spielberg look trite and elementary At the time of it s release Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary gem that it raised the bar of film making to levels never anticipated by film makers The concept of making not just a motion picture featuring a dinosaur but adapting an action packed thrilling detective novel co staring a talking dinosaur with a post modern name such as Theodore and an existential female police officer changed humanity as we know it The world could never be the same after experiencing such magnificent beauty Watching Theodore Rex is much akin to looking into the face of God and hearing Him say you are my most beloved creation This is one of the few films that is simply TO DIE FOR
1	The memory of the The Last Hunt has stuck with me since I saw it in when I was It is a movie that was far ahead of others at the time in that it addressed the treatment of the natives the environment and the ever present contrast between the short and long term effects of greed It is as relevant today as in a cinemagraphic discussion of utmost depth and relevance To top it off the setting is beautiful and the cinematography excellent The memory of this movie will be with me to the end of my days
0	I think I ve seen worse films so I m giving this a but it s a struggle to remember what they could have been Possibly Xtro nasty dull or possibly Creep just plain dull but it is a struggle to think of something worse It s difficult to know where to start Let s just say it s a poor man s Under Siege starring an even poorer man s Jean Claude Van Damme The only redeeming feature was seeing Casper Van Dien I always wondered what happened to him after Starship Troopers Yes he was Johnny Rico if you really want to know Judging from this site he s been stuck in TV movie hell Casper be more selective please Arghhhhh I ve just turned over and there s a half decent film on called Criminal Law now I m beginning to get really resentful about the last hrs
1	I m not a Steve Carell fan however I like this movie about Dan an advice columnist who goes to his parents house for a stay with his kids and ends up falling in love with his brother s girlfriend Its a story thats been told before but not like this There are simply too many little bits that make the film better than it should be The cast is wonderful and even if Carell is not my cup of tea he is quite good as the widower who s suppose to know everything but finds that knowing is different than feeling and that sometimes life surprises you At times witty and wise in the way that an annoying Hallmark card can be the film still some how manages to grow on you and be something more than a run of the mill film Worth a look see
1	First this was a BRAVE film I ve seen Irreversible and can understand the comparisons However I cannot begin to understand the people who ve trashed this film I can see how the end may have come off extreme but I d be lying if I didn t say I wished that every guy who s ever forced a woman into sex deserved exactly what Jared got Conversely it didn t solve anything or make anything better and the fact that the film doesn t pretend to is what made me appreciate it The comment prior to this one called the film pathetic and claimed no adult would stick with I certainly did and intently I m years old The way the film drags made it realistic to me People have become so used to eye candy and fast paced plots on screen that if you ask them to concentrate too long on one brick in the foundation of a film not only do they lose interest they demolish whatever has been built and call it rubbish When in actuality it s their lack of patience and comprehension that needs fine tuning and not the product of a creative mind such as Talia Lugacy s Rosario Dawson displayed the numbness of self destruction flawlessly I think she portrayed Maya pre and post assault with great ease and the transition between the two is an act I rarely ever see done well Often times much like the films aimed at teens mentioned in the prior comment the effects of rape are displayed as either extremely manic and impulsive or terribly depressed isolated and lifeless Dawson in my opinion manages to perform the balancing act so many survivors fall prey to drone like existence in the waking hours working some dead end job to survive and distract and then overindulging in vices in order to lose themselves in the haze of substance abuse rather than face what sobriety brings I thought this film told the truth and I appreciated it for finally showing people a different side of rape So many people let the end of this film devour the middle and the beginning I believe that Maya s face during the act was the end not the act itself not the vengeance or the meaning behind it just her face thank you
0	If you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood let it be boy But prepare yourself by bringing your hp if it comes with a radio After having watched such a good movie as Arisan it is terrible to see what they come up with again in Indonesia It seems that the only idea is to make money but no one seems seriously to work on the image of Indonesia in the world of entertainment That it is a global world doesn t seem to come up in the minds of those who make movies in Indonesia And since the Indonesian public swallows everything that is presented to them as Made in Indonesia with a flavor of the west they get away with it OK the story is nice to begin with And it could have developed into a nice flick But did the director never think about the fact that a musical needs first of all live music OR at least good playback and secondly good choreography In this movie the playback is SO BAD that it makes you wanna cry right there in the cinema Every single word you hear is followed seconds LATER by the actor or whoever sing playback and it is extremely annoying while watching the movie The choreography is as if they planned to make a movie about morning gymnastics but in the end thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical They only forgot to change the choreography It is hardly dancing you see they jump here and there throw their legs up in the air and that is about it Well at least there s a happy ending But if you can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlelight dinner is much more romantic DO SO
0	Well you know the rest This has to be the worst movie I ve seen in a long long time I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this role The lead role is played by to me a complete unknown and I would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkey Bruce Lee led the martial arts charge in the early s and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques This movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts however even this can t disguise the fact that the lady doesn t know how to throw a punch An average year old boy would take her apart on this showing Sorry the only mystery on show here is how this didn t win the golden raspberry for its year
0	Office work especially in this era of computers multi functional copy machines e mail voice mail snail mail and temps is territory ripe with satirical possibilities a vein previously tapped in such films as Clockwatchers and Office Space and very successfully This latest addition to the temp humor pool however Haiku Tunnel directed by Josh Kornbluth and Jacob Kornbluth fails to live up to it s predecessors and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door waiting for a chance to sneak in Unfortunately for the audience that chance never comes so what you get is a nice try but as the man once said no cigar As the narrator star of the film Josh Kornbluth playing Josh Kornbluth points out in the opening frames in a monologue delivered directly into the camera this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of San Franc l isco It s an innovative if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer and not all that funny It is however a harbinger of what is to follow all of which like the disclaimer just isn t all that funny Kornbluth plays Kornbluth an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a temp It s a job that suits him and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time But when he goes to work for a lawyer Bob Shelby Warren Keith he does too good a job on the first day and Shelby dispatches head secretary Marlina D Amore Helen Shumaker to Kornbluth to persuade him to go perm The thought of working full time for the same company though initially strikes fear in the heart of Kornbluth but he caves in and signs on for the position He s nervous about it but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence which of course they would never do with a temp and if things get too rough he has seventeen important letters he s typed up that now just have to be mailed out to fall back on he s been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part and he needs that something easy to do in reserve in case it all gets to be too much for him These are important letters however and by the end of the week Kornbluth still has them in reserve on his desk And it doesn t take a genius to figure out that when Shelby finds out about it Kornbluth s days as the fair haired boy are going to be over And quick The Brothers Kornbluth who not only directed but along with John Bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film should have taken a page out of the Ben Stiller Book of Comedy where it says If you play it straight they will laugh But they didn t and the audience won t Because in comedy even looking at it as objectively as possible when the main character as well as most of the supporting characters in this case Plays funny as in he knows he s being funny he never is And that s exactly what Kornbluth does here so rather than being funny he comes across as insincere and pretentious a grievous error in judgment on the part of the Kornbluths because by allowing it they sabotaged their own movie In trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn t work it comes down to two basic reasons The directing which if not necessarily bad is at least careless and secondly the performances beginning with that of Josh Kornbluth Quite simply Kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here Unlike Stiller or even Steve Martin both of whom use self deprecating humor very effectively Kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he the real Kornbluth is in reality much more clever than Kornbluth the character And being unable to get past that does him in as well as the film Rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify Kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach So what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter it s easy to understand why this one just doesn t fly The one saving grace of the film is the performance by Warren Keith as Shelby whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in and of itself is fairly humorous The effectiveness of it is diminished however inasmuch as Keith has to share his scenes with Kornbluth which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project Shumaker and Sarah Overman Julie Faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable they at least make their scenes watchable and Overman even manages to elevate Kornbluth s performance if only momentarily But it s still not enough to save the day or the film The supporting cast includes Amy Resnick Mindy Brian Thorstenson Clifford June Lomena DaVonne Joe Bellan Jimmy the Mail Clerk with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking Harry Shearer as the Orientation Leader a role that begs for an answer to the question What was he thinking when he agreed to this In any work environment there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone s comedic cannon and the films depicting said situations will always be with us the good ones see paragraph one may even become classics in their own right Haiku Tunnel however will doubtfully remain very long amongst them for it s destiny lies elsewhere in a realm known only as Obscurity I rate this one
1	I have been wanting to see cut since the day i have heard of it which was sometime last year Anyway i got to see today and when the movie started i thought that it started rather week but it got better after mins or so I thought that the movie was pretty good but the thing i didn t like was how the killer was created i was thinking just before i rented that it would probably suck just like Urban legends final cut i almost died it mostly everything in UL final cut needed to be improved CUT is times better than UL final cut The best part of CUT is the killer and the death scenes The killer kicks MO F ING ASS i give cut a out of

0	I can t believe it IMDb really does have every TV show known to man I have not seen this show in over years I only remember two episodes and I barely remember those I remember that Tony may not been on from the start because one of the episodes I remember is the one in which everybody trying to get Tony to join but he rejects them but typically at the end of the show he becomes a member of Power House with everybody cheering The other one I remember is the one where Lolo for some reason pretends to be dead complete with funeral and mourners I don t remember why he plays dead or how the show ends This is one of those shows that I convinced myself that I must have dreamed up since no one else had ever heard of it
1	Simple minded but good natured drive in movie about a simple minded but good natured high school graduate who has dreams of owning the coolest custom van in the world to use as his ballroom Bobby our hero spends his entire savings to acquire the vehicle of his dreams Joint sharing and love making quickly commence with girls Bobby has picked up at the local pizza parlor but he finds out much responsibility danger and heartache come with being the owner of such a mechanical marvel The Van is a guilty pleasure of mine It captures the laid back mid s mood and has enough unintentional humor to put it into the so bad it s good category
0	There is a key aspect of film that Jobson seems to have forgotten it has the ability to tell a story by showing it to you You don t need to tell the audience what to think because they ll see it The action here is interspersed with some of the most ponderous narration unleashed on the unsuspecting public the purple prose of the sensitive fifth former And it should be unnecessary because their is a fine cast here and some beautifully composed and shot visuals Maybe Jobbo felt that the basic story needed a lit bit of support And he may have been right it lacks a basic credibility s Edinburgh wasn t exactly full of beautiful brainy girls with a penchant for the Velvet Underground and a soft spot for a passing sociopath From the too neat and new looking clothes that character wears to the cod intellectualism that tries to link it all together it s all too contrived for my taste
1	I first saw Ice Age in the Subiaco Cinemas when it came out back in I was only at the time but even then I liked it It had some sort of warmth We ve had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it it never gets boring This is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other D animations made at the time The characters have no particular home which they leave They are nomads and that s really refreshing and uplifting to watch Also each individual character on the surface appear to be just putting up with each other but they re really all good friends As well all of the characters have their own charms even the bad guys Sid the sloth is charming in his annoying over affectionate and naive sort of way Manny is adorable in his depressed reclusive character and so on and so forth Another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation All the environments and characters were modeled originally by clay giving the film an artistic edge Another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie is that gender means very little There are hardly any female characters but you don t really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film Due to this there s also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age All in all Ice Age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into d animations before Shrek and The Incredibles came out
0	Well I just ordered this on my pay per view at home because I was bored and needed a laugh I have to admit I did chuckle a few times but I don t even remember what parts they were at I don t understand why this movie was made It claims to be a comedy but seriousuly I don t find a singing penis or a naked year old woman very funny This movie was trying to fit itself into the gross out comedies of recent years such as American Pie and Road Trip but it just failed miserably It was way to much gross out then it was comedy Also why on earth did Cameron Diaz attach her name to this movie The only thing I liked about this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool I thought it was sexy and enjoyable and well done Besides that avoid this movie
1	This movie isn t as bad as I heard It was enjoyable funny and I love that is revolves around the holiday season It totally has me in the mood to Christmas shop and listen to holiday music When this movie comes out on DVD it will take the place of Christmas Vacation in my collection It will be a movie to watch every year after Thanksgiving to get me in the mood for the best time of the year I heard that Ben s character was a bit crazy but I think it just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time Take it for what is it a Christmas comedy with a love twist I enjoyed it No it isn t Titanic and it won t make your heart pound with anticipation but it will bring on a laugh or two So go laugh and have a good time
1	If the creators of this film had made any attempt at introducing reality to the plot it would have been just one more waste of time money and creative effort Fortunately by throwing all pretense of reality to the winds they have created a comedic marvel Who could pass up a film in which an alien pilot spends the entire film acting like Jack Nicholson complete with the Lakers T shirt Do not dismiss this film as trash
0	Really really bad slasher movie A psychotic person escapes from an asylum Three years later he kills a sociology professor end of scene One semester yesterday later hey that s what the title card said a new sociology professor is at the school She makes friends with another female sociology professor who works there and starts dating another professor The students are all bored as are we There are a number of title cards indicating how much time has passed Scenes are pretty short and cut to different characters somewhere else making for little progression of any kind A lot of scenes involve characters walking and talking or sitting and talking and serve little purpose Despite the passage of time many of the characters are always wearing the same clothing Sometimes the unclear passage of time means when we see a body for the second time we ask ourselves how long has that body been there And also at least one of the dead people don t seem to have been missed by others The killer manages to kill one person by stabbing her in the breast another by stabbing him in the crotch and another by slicing her forehead Is his knife poisoned or something The video box cover has a cheerleader there aren t any in the movie The rear cover has a photo of someone in a graduation cap and gown menacing a group of women in a dorm room The central redhead in the photo is in the movie but nobody ever wears such an outfit and there is no such scene The killer is strictly one on one

1	I am always so frustrated that the majority of science fiction movies are really intergalactic westerns or war dramas Even Star Wars which is visually brilliant has one of its central images a futuristic gang that couldn t shoot straight Imagine your coming upon about people with conventional weapons most of them having an open shot and they miss I have read much science fiction and wish there were more movies for the thinking person Forbidden Planet one of the earliest of the genre is still one of the very best The story is based on a long extinct civilization the Krell who created machines which could boost the intelligence of any being by quantum leaps Unfortunately what they hadn t bargained for is that the brain is a center for other thoughts than intellectual The primitive aspect of the brain the Id as Freud called it is allowed to go unchecked It is released in sleep a bad dream come to corporeal existence Walter Pigeon Dr Morbius is the one who has jacked his brain to this level and with it has built machines and defenses that keep him barely one step ahead of the horrors of the recesses of his own mind His thoughts are creating horrors that he soon will not be able to defend The Krell a much superior species could not stop it it destroyed them The landing party has never been of great interest to me The rest of the actors are pretty interchangeable Ann Francis is beautiful and naive and certainly would have produced quite a reaction in the fifties adolescent male Her father s ire is exacerbated by her innocence and the wolfy fifties astronauts for they are more like construction workers on the make than real astronauts They are always trying to figure out dames The cook is a great character with his obsession for hooch Robbie the Robot has much more personality than most of the crew and one wonders if Mr Spock may not be a soulmate to the literal thinking of this artificial creature The whole movie is very satisfying because the situation is the star Morbius can t turn back and so he is destined to destroy himself and everything with him There are few science fiction films that are worth seeing more than once this is one that can coast right into the st century
1	It was only on my second viewing years later that I realized two things about this movie I enjoyed it immensely and that because its execution is decidedly sharper than the premise itself warrants I had laughed my way through the movie before it occurred to me to renew my initial protests valleyspeak and loogies and airheadedness even good natured airheadedness just aren t inherently funny especially when drawn out to feature length But though the movie s momentum does begin to sputter out towards the end Reeves and Winter and Sadler and Hal Landon Jr in an unforgettable scene display such a remarkable sense of comic timing throughout that even the more clumsily scripted jokes e g Ted failing to recognize a certain inhabitant of Hell work as effortlessly as the witter ones e g the challenge And the teaming of Winter and Reeves clicks so well that the teaming of Bill and Ted who spend only one scene separated in the entire movie disaster if they re not well matched appears utterly unstrained Side note I found the first movie to be only sporadically entertaining sightly different comic sensibilities there it seems I give it a Surprisingly good fun
0	This early role for Barbara Shelley in fact her first in Britain after working in Italy was made when she was years old and it s certainly safe to say that she made a stunning debut in s Cat Girl While blondes and brunettes get most of the attention I ll always cherish Yutte Stensgaard the lovely auburn haired actress with the deep voice always exuded intelligence as well as vulnerability one such example being s Village of the Damned in which her screen time was much less than her character s husband George Sanders She is the sole reason for seeing this drab update of Cat People and is seen to great advantage throughout it s difficult to say if her beauty found an even better showcase Her character apparently sleeps in the nude and we are exposed to her luscious bare back when she is awakened also exposed years later in s Rasputin The Mad Monk The ravishing gown she wears during most of the film is a stunning strapless wonder I don t see what held that dress up but I d sure like to All in all proof positive that Barbara Shelley in a poorly written role that would defeat most actresses rises above her material and makes the film consistently watchable a real test of star power which she would find soon enough at Hammer s studios in Bray for the duration of the s
0	this movie is not good the first one almost sucked but had that unreal ending to make it worth watching this one has nothing there s zero scare zero tension or suspense this isn t really a horror movie most of the kills don t show anything there s no gore to speak of this could almost be a TV except for a bit of nudity and a bit of violence the acting is not very good either and don t get me started on the dialogue as for the surprise ending surprise there isn t one i suppose it could have been worse although i don t see how but then again it is less than minutes long so i guess that s a good thing although it felt a lot longer apparently this is the cut version of the film i found it for a very cheap price but it still not worth it if you want the uncut more graphic version check out the Anchor Bay edition anyway this version of Sleepaway Camp II Unhappy Campers gets a big fat from me p s if you watch this movie you will probably be a bored and unhappy camper if you are a real fan you might want to pick up Anchor Bay s Sleepaway Camp with survival kit three disc collection containing the first three movies uncut and with special features
1	I haven t seen all of Jess Franco s movies I have seen I think and there are more than of them So maybe it s a bit early to say so but Necronomicon Getr umte S nden better known as Succubus but that is the cut version is according to me if not the best certainly on of Franco s best Franco is best known although known might be slightly exaggerated for Vampiros Lesbos a weird cultish movie that got more acclaim in the mid s when people found out Jess Franco was also an interesting composer Through the soundtrack a happy few discovered the man and found out what was to be expected after seeing the video clip of The lion and the cucumber Vampyros Lesbos OST Jess Franco is an overwhelming director When the phone rang during Vampiros I let it ring I just wanted to see more of the movie Since that moment Franco never could grip me that much But then I stumbled on this movie It is even better than Vampiros Lesbos I think Franco is looking for what he can do with a story and a camera We find out he can do a lot I certainly didn t expect to find Necronomicon that great its beginning didn t impress me at all Remember I had seen Vampiros Lesbos before although chronologically that came only three years later and both movies kinda start the same But then the story went on puzzling and gripping beautiful camera work and the stuff you would like to see Godard do if he weren t so occupied with spreading his political messages Later on in the movie I heard a dialogue about which art was or wasn t old fashioned The man says that all movies have to be old fashioned because it takes weeks before the audience sees what got filmed But the girl replies that Bunuel Fritz Lang and Godard yesterday made movies for tomorrow Janine Reynaud is an interesting lead actress and of course Howard Vernon a Franco regular is also there Luckily the acting is good something that can spoil a lot of Franco movies for you but not this one But certainly watch out for the dummy scene The erotic tension the wild directing and the fact that it s a yesterday s movie for tomorrow make it a movie a lot of people should see The fact that it is a bit more accessible than Vampiros Lesbos certainly helps
1	This is a very chilling and for the most part a well thought out drama I am very impressed at the film not just for the plot and superb acting but that such a unique movie was made Most movies involving a spy or a war are filled with a slick talking Brit or a mighty battle but not this This isn t about this kind of war its about the war between a man and his position in life an American spy in Germany posing as a supporter of an evil no one will ever forget When the war is over Campell thinks he will come home as a hero but his true heroic stance must remain a government secret Going back to America Campell meets Nazi supporters as well as Nazi haters providing for interesting conflicts both internally and externally Nolte more than pulls off the role and fits the plot quite well for what it s asking

1	One of the finest films ever made Why it only got a rating is a mystery This film is a window into the world of the black experience in America Should be mandatory viewing for all white people and all children above age I recommend watching it with The Long Walk Home as a companion piece If you think Whoopi Goldberg s work is about Homer and Eddie or Hollywood Squares think again Don t miss this movie which should have won the Oscar And read the book too
0	This flick was a blow to me I guess little girls should aspire to be nothing more than swimsuit models home makers or mistresses since that seems to be all they ll ever be portrayed as anyway It is truly saddening to see an artist s work and life being so unjustly misinterpretated Inconcievably or perhaps it should have been expected Artemisia s entire character and all that she stands for had been reduced to a standard Hollywood female character a pitiful physically flawless helpless little creature displaying none of the character traits that actually got her that place in history which was being mutilated here Sadder yet was to see that a great part of the audience was too badly educated in the area to comprehend the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film and reality To portray the artist as someone in love with her real life rapist someone whom she in reality accused of raping her even when under torture just plain pisses me off If the director had nothing more substantial to say she should have refrained from basing her story on a real person
0	aka DEMONS III Made for Italian TV although shot in English and was never meant to be a sequel to the earlier DEMONS films It was supposed to be simply titled THE OGRE which is how director Lamberto Bava had released it An American family rents an Italian villa for the summer The woman Virginia Bryant has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine cellar of this villa an encountering this cocoon like structure hanging down from the ceiling It glows and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect legs hanging down from it It drips what looks like green paint Of course the husband doesn t believe any of this The villa just is old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it But then the OGRE itself appears in what looks like some kind of th Centaury costume with what looks like a wolf s head attached to it and it s attracted to the scent of orchids The films isn t really that bad and at least the dialog is halfway intelligent without the ridiculous awkward phrases that dubbing would bring There s no real gore other than some skeletons rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool The OGRE itself just simply fades away after it is run over by the family s Jeep Cherokee The copy of the Shriek DVD I watched was defective with the picture going black for a few seconds about a half an hour into the film a flaw I hope Shriek has since corrected Extras include a short interview with Lamberto Bava where he explains how this wasn t a sequel etc etc along with some trailers to other Shriek DVD releases This is pretty standard stuff out of

1	Really and incredible film that though isn t very popular extremely touching and almost life altering was for me at least Definitely worth seeing and buying Added to my favorite movie list it s number one now This is a very touching movie that all people should see The Man in the Moon we ll it s just incredible It s now my favorite movie and I only saw it today and I d recommend it to anyone above as long as you re somewhat mature If you don t really try to feel the characters emotions then you ll never get the true meaning and value of this movie But it really is incredible just watch it because it ll alter the way some people look at life worth seeing
0	This kind of film has become old hat by now hasn t it The whole thing is syrupy nostalgia turned in upon itself in some kind of feedback loop It sure sounds like a good idea a great ensemble cast some good gags and some human drama about what could have might have been Unfortunately there is no central event that binds them all together like there was in The Big Chill one of those seminal movies that spawned copycat films like this one You end up wanting to see more of one or two particular people instead of getting short takes on everyone The superficiality this creates is not just annoying it s maddening The below average script doesn t help

1	Taiwanese director Ang Lee whose previous films include Sense and Sensibility and The Ice Storm turned to the American Civil War for his latest feature Based on a novel by Daniel Woodrell it follows the exploits of a group of Southern guerrillas known as bushwhackers as they fight their Northern equivalents the jayhawkers in the backwater of Missouri As one might expect there is plenty of visceral action but the focus is on the tension that the war put on the young men who fought it many of whom were fighting against their former neighbours and even family Jake Roedel Tobey Maguire is such a man or rather boy as he is only seventeen when the war reaches Missouri He is the son of a German immigrant but instead of following his countrymen and becoming a Unionist he joins his lifelong friend Jack Bull Chiles Skeet Ulrich and rides with the bushwhackers Despite a lack of acceptance because of his ancestry and an unwillingness to participate in the murder of unarmed Union men he remains loyal to the cause So does his friend Daniel Holt Jeffrey Wright a black slave freed by another bushwhacker and so fighting for the South Lee handles the subject with aplomb never rushing the deep introspection that the plot demands in favour of action and this lends the film a sense of the reality of war long periods of boredom and waiting interposed with occasional flashes of intensely terrifying fighting The action is unglamorised and admirably candid recognising that both sides committed a great number of atrocities The performances are superb with Maguire and Wright both courageous and dignified Up and coming Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers is particularly chilling as a cold blooded killer while Skeet Ulrich is enjoyably suave and arrogant Lee never flinches from the reality of war but his actors do an admirable job of showing the good that comes from it the growth of friendship the demonstration of courage and on a wider scale the emancipation of oppressed peoples Ride With the Devil is a beautiful and deeply compassionate film that regularly shocks but always moves the audience

0	I bought this on DVD for my brother who is a big Michelle Pfeiffer fan I decided to watch it myself earlier this week It is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two She plays a rising Hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships She literally bumps into Brian Kerwin A regular married guy with Kids after driving her car into the back of his After being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive Romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out What happens at the end I was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine TV direction takes any drama out of the plot The other section involves an old Studio boss played by Darren McGavin This section actually has the better cast with Kenneth McMillan Lois Chiles Steven Bauer Stella Stevens They all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere It passes the time but is not all that interesting and I am glad this was not bought for me I am not a Michelle Pffeifer fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in she was a decent actress Overall though unless you are a fan of hers avoid this as it is very routine
1	This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time All of you who regard this movie as absolute sh t obviusly are not intelligent enough to grasp all of the subtle humor that this movie has to offer It shows us that real life and ficticious action can produce a winning combination Also as a romantic comedy it has one of the most clever ways for two people to find each other Name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as Donald Sutherland singing a song like They re Going to Find Your Anus On A Mountain On Mars
1	I think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness The film is set in just before the entry of the US into the war Paul Lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family He s a German who has spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding capture Bette Davis is his very understanding and long suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time As the film begins they are crossing the border from Mexico to the USA and for the first time in years they are going to relax and stop running The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems While this had a very noble goal at the time it just seems phony today In particular the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn t ring true It sounded more like anti Fascism speeches than the voices of real children They were as a result extremely annoying particularly the littlest one who came off at times as a brat About the only ones who sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian living with them though he had no discernible accent It s really tough to believe that the ultra famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog as it just doesn t sound true to life The story was based on the play by his lover Lillian Hellman And the basic story idea and plot is good but the dialog is just bad at times Overall an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments but that s really about all
0	This movie was so bad I don t know whether to laugh or cry I had high hopes for Horrorfest that year which was also the first year I attended Horrorfest and I have to say Horrorfest and all of its films take false advertising to a whole new level Mad kudos to the advertisers because I m sure they tricked a lot of people into spending money and seeing those movies that year The Hamiltons was easily the worst one of the ones I ve seen the other ones I saw were Unrest Dark Ride and Reincarnation The movie cover and trailer made it seem like a family of cannibals terrorizing the neighborhood which I thought was a rather interesting plot only to be disappointed at the end discovering that it was some coming of age tale about a boy s transition into being a vampire Which is why drama prevails over any sense of horror in this film And to make the plot even more ridiculous they add in a set of horny twins who can t wait to take a bite out of one another and some deadly creature locked in the basement which if I had discovered what it was had the secret not been revealed at the very end of the film I would have left the theater halfway into the movie Complete waste of money and time Cut forty minutes out of this film and make it into an episode on some show like Smallville or Charmed or Supernatural and it would have received more praise than this Absolute rubbish So bad that two years later I have to come back to IMDb and write a review about it because it still stands out in my memory as one of the worst movies I ve ever seen Also while you re reading this steer clear from the rest of the Horrorfest movies in the future The most you could do is rent them from Blockbusters or watch it online somewhere Horrorfest features movies from independent filmmakers who can t make it onto the big screen and all the crap about stuff they don t show you in theaters they weren t referring to blood or guts or horror they were referring to the movies themselves Because they re horrendous Think of Horrorfest as a less renowned version of Sundance Film Festival but for horror movies Sorry for all the hate but next time think twice before you cheat costumers out of their money
0	The trailers for this film were better than the movie What waste of talent and money Wish I would ve waited for this movie to come on DVD because at least I wouldn t be out The movie totally misses the mark What could have been a GREAT movie for all actors turned out to be a B movie at best Movie moved VERY slow and just when I thought it was going somewhere it almost did but then it didn t In this day and age we need unpredictable plot twists and closures in film and this film offered neither The whole thing about how everyone is a suspect is good however not sure if it was the way it was directed the lighting the delivery of lines the writing or what but nothing came from it Lot of hype for nothing I was VERY disappointed in this film and I m telling everyone NOT to see it The cheesy saxophone music throughout made the film worse as well And the ending had NOTHING to do with the rest of the film What a disappointment
1	I was pleased to see that she had black hair I ve been a fan for about years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the stories I was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer it didn t spoil it at all In fact I watched the film twice in one day a sure sign that it was up to standard This is what I do with books that I like as well I thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of Modesty Blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip I would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about baddies having to be ugly Has he actually read the books I thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with anticipation
1	The first time I saw this episode was like a shock to me it was actually the first time I saw The speed things are happening is amazing and it s so surprising thrilling and even interesting it s almost as if you are reading a book once you start it it s very hard to stop From the minute Richard Walsh was talking privately to Jack about the possibility that they have a mole inside CTU I was sitting hours which means episodes Sounds funny and crazy but I m the kind of guy which when he is interested he just can t stop This series is one of the best of it s kind And it s build in a way of having a few different stories that are being connected together Recommended in every way
0	While the idea is more original than most Sci Fi movies the execution is as usual lacking While the practical mummy effects are not bad and the Gun Nut character is over the top giggle inducing the only real draw is to see Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin reunited on the small screen I suspect that was the idea all along They do the best they can with what they have but the must see moments for me were in the first minutes or so when Morena s character sported some Tomb Raider style shorts Not high brow cinema I know but you can t deny true beauty when you see it And Adam Baldwin once again hams it up as the guy you love to hate If you just want to watch a couple of your favorite Firefly characters have a good time with some sub par material then this might be for you If you want good acting and character development then be advised to look elsewhere
1	Tom Hanks like you ve never seen him before Hanks plays Michael Sullivan The Angel of Death He is a hitman for his surrogate father John Rooney Paul Newman an elderly Irish mob boss Sullivan s young son Tyler Hoechlin witnesses what his father does for a living and both are soon on the road for seven weeks robbing banks to avenge the murder of Sullivan s wife and other son Enter Jude Law as a reporter photographer willing to kill Sullivan himself for the chance to add to his collection of photos of dead mobsters Filmed beautifully catching the drama of life in the s Sometimes the pace bogs down but then a burst of graphic violence sustains the story Director Sam Mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty responsibility betrayal and the bonding of a secretive man and his young son Other notable cast members are Dylan Baker Stanley Tucci Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh Hanks again proves to be excellent in a very memorable movie Make room for some Oscars
1	First of all I think the below comment is unworthy for a site like this Obviously you have no taste and you don t respect the taste of others Not to give you a history lesson but I think it needs to be done Black actors out there are just if not more successful as others If you are not a part of the Black race you cannot understand the quality creativeness and vibrant of old movies such as Sparkle and Mahogany and Cooley High Since unfortunately you are not Black you do not have the pleasure of feeling what we feel when we watch these classics so therefore you need to keep your freaking mouth shut and just stick to your non dancing race Thanks
1	Deliverance is a stunning thriller every bit as exciting as any good thriller should aspire to be but also stomach churningly frightening Though it is not a horror movie it is just as terrifying as any classic horror film The very thought of being a normal red blooded male enjoying an adventure weekend miles from any form of civilisation only to be captured and sodomised by a couple of violent hillbillies is surely the worst nightmare of of the world s population It would have been easy for Deliverance to slip into exploitation territory but John Boorman has cleverly avoided the temptation to go down such a route and has made a film that explores questions and challenges the very meaning of masculinity With so many films you come away wishing to heaven that you could step into the hero s shoes performing heroic deeds and saving the day and getting the girl but with Deliverance you come away praying to God that you ll never have to experience what these four protagonists go through Four city guys Ed Jon Voight Lewis Burt Reynolds Drew Ronny Cox and Bobby Ned Beatty head out into the wilderness to spend a few days canoing down a soon to be dammed river The guys are riding the rapids in pairs and Ed and Bobby inadvertently get a little too far ahead of the others so they pull in to the riverside and await their pals in the adjacent woodland Here they fall foul of two local woodlanders Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward who tie Ed to a tree while one of them strips and rapes Bobby instructing him perversely to squeal like a pig Lewis and Drew arrive unseen and Lewis being a fair archer kills the rapist while the other hillbilly beats a hasty retreat into the forest Under great emotional stress the four canoeists decide to conceal the event and get out of the area But they find the river increasingly dangerous to negotiate as they journey downstream and the risk to their lives heightens when the surviving hillbilly returns to take shots at them with his rifle from some unseen vantage point in the rocky cliffs beside the river Deliverance is very powerful as a survival tale but even more powerful and disturbing as a study of macho attitudes being torn apart and left in humiliated tatters Though all the performances are remarkable one must take particular note of Beatty s efforts in a role that many actors would ve turned down The film is very similar thematically to the film Straw Dogs both films deal with terrifying sexual violence in isolated locales and in both the eventual violent revenge exacted by the victim does not result in any sense of satisfaction The backdrop of the rugged countryside in Deliverance is beautiful to look at but it also adds to the tension by placing the four canoeists in a setting where they are at the mercy of the hillbillies and the landscape with nobody to rely on other than themselves This truly is suspenseful film making at its finest
1	My watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel together which makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships As a lot has been written about the movie already it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally loved I think the point where Jesse and Celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending hrs the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt with On the plot front making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish I believe in romantic flicks of such flavor the characters are not clearly designed even in the writer s and director s mind What the actors bring out is what becomes of them right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify to become the character the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the story here both the actors do just the RIGHT job Kudos and Before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful
0	Quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom A group of top quality actors in the main well cast with a couple of notable exceptions who give pretty good performances Penelope Keith is perfect as Aunt Louise and equally good is Joanna Lumley as Diana All do well with the scripts they were given So much for the good The average would include the sets Nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book although bizarrely the house they use for the Dower House looks remarkably like it It is clear then that the Dower House is far too big In the later parts the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the UK presumably to save money although with a little imagination I have no doubt they could have recreated Ceylon Now to the bad The screenplay This is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it Edward does not die in the battle of Britain but survives blinded He makes a brief appearance then commits suicide why Loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with Gus to a sensible farmer s wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear less emotional than Brief Encounter Gus a man besotted and passionately in love is prepared to give up his love without complaint Walter Mudge in the book turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man Jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won t speak Aunt Biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification The Dower House is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with Jess who has a fear of armed soldiers Whilst Miss Mortimer s breasts are utterly delightful I could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward The delightfully named Nettlebed becomes the mundane Dobson The word limit prevents me from continuing the list There is a sequel which I lost all interest in watching after this nonsense and I wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story It is difficult to image that Rosamunde Pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased
0	An obvious b grade effort to cash in on the Hostel Saw buzz my expectations for this film were low really low and yet it still managed to disappoint on every level The acting is so bad it s not even funny the plot line is non existent and the only scare was realizing that I had wasted hour minutes watching it I m surprised to note that people gave it a star rating I can only suspect that of these are Cast and Crew The th is possibly the directors mother although I m sure even she would find it hard to go higher than a DVD extras include an hour long making of feature Which raises the question Why although perhaps it serves to demonstrate what not to do Avoid at all costs
0	This is exactly the sort of Saturday matinee serial I loved during World War II I was under ten years of age And that s the audience this serial is designed for Looking at it now one must roar at its ineptitude and stupidity The budget must have been next to nothing given the shortcuts and repeats The acting Well this is Republic pictures They read the lines and no doubt had one take to make them convincing One and half stars
0	To call a film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from beyond the grave lame and lifeless would be too ironical but this here is an undeniably undistinguished combination of GASLIGHT via LES DIABOLIQUES while still watchable in itself it s so clich ridden as to provoke chuckles instead of the intended chills However thanks to the dire straits in which the British film industry found itself in the late s even a mediocre script such as this one was able to attract star names Cliff Robertson as the conniving husband Jean Simmons in the title role Jenny Agutter as Robertson s artist half sister Simon Ward as the enigmatic chauffeur Ron Moody as an ill fated doctor Michael Jayston as Robertson s business partner Judy Geeson as Simmons best friend and Jayston s wife Flora Robson as the housekeeper David Tomlinson as the notary reading Simmons will and most surprisingly perhaps Jack Warner as a gravestone sculptor although most of them actually have nothing parts I m sorry to say
1	Well I gave this movie a It was better than Thirdspace but not as good as In the Beginning as far as the B movies go I really think the television series did a much better job overall with the special effects and character portrayal Let s hope the producers and cast get the next series Crusade up to the standards of B
0	This film was choppy incoherent and contrived It was also an extremely mean spirited portrayal of women I rented it because it was listed as a comedy that s a stretch and because the cover said Andie McDowell was acting up a storm in it She wasn t I m a gal I watched this film with two guys and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it was WARNING PLOT SUMMARY BELOW RAMPANT SPOILERS The movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man to the severe disapproval of her two jealous single girlfriends They want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her But she s so happy with her oversexed puppy that you re rooting for them to stick it out and sure enough she decides to marry the guy But her harpy girlfriend aided by the wishy washy one sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her It works She has a fight with him he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck Remember the movie s title So now he s dead two thirds of the way through the film And although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnant She s already broken off relations with her girlfriends because they were so unsupportive Alone and pitiful she decides to marry the boring guy Did I mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister She had asked him to marry her to the young guy nice huh but now she tells him she ll marry him and apparently he has no objections to being dicked around in this fashion But her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home where they not quite confess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed She has the kid In the final scene they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink smoke and be smug I kid you not it s that bad I left out the part about the cancer red herring and the harpy s ridiculous lesbian moment
1	In a series chock full of brilliant episodes this one stands out as one of my very favorites It s not the most profound episode there s no great meaning or message But it s a lot of fun and there are some fine performances But what makes it really stand out for me is that it is to my knowledge the only Twilight Zone episode with a double snapper ending The Zone is rightly famous for providing a big surprise at the end of a story But this time you get a surprise and think that s that but it turns out there s another surprise waiting I just like that so much that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes the other being a deeper more message oriented one
0	Who in their right mind plays a lyrical song at the same time they are portraying an emotional scene between two people When Flipper confronts his wronged wife in the dressing room the song sung with lyrical content is as loud as the dialog so one can hear neither diluting any emotional impact the scene may have had The scenes of Annabella getting beaten by her father with his fists a lamp and then a belt was so cartoonish as to be absurd This entire movie is a cartoon the rampant prejudice against whites is literally astounding The discussion by the black women after flipper s wife finds out he has cheated on her with a white woman as if it were a discussion by an oxford debating team is ridiculous The rampant racism might be possible to endure but the soundtrack and the sound mixing during this movie is too much It was a technically poorly made movie There is no understanding of the basic craft of movie making the sound track the editing and the desperate attempt of great actors trying to keep this movie afloat I actually felt sorry for Anthony Quinn wondering why he had accepted a role in this flick his appearance in this is painful This is the first movie I have seen by this director and it will be my last
0	As far as the movie goes it s an OK science fiction movie It has a lot of cool stuff in it and some quality scenes That said it s not that good and some of the stuff is pretty far fetched As for calling this another cube movie is utter and complete bullsh t This is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original movie The whole feel to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first but the introduction of people androids as part of the team behind the cube itself is somewhat a stretch I gave this a because of the backstabbing of the original This one should have been kept sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all Watchable for those who have not seen Cube Hypercube but not recommendable for fans of the series
1	Uggh I really wasn t that impressed by this film though I must admit that it is technically well made It does get a for very high production values but as for entertainment values it is rather poor In fact I consider this one of the most overrated films of the s It won the Oscar for Best Picture but the film is just boring at times with so much dancing and dancing and dancing That s because unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs along with a strong story and acting such as MEET ME IN ST LOUIS this movie is almost all singing and dancing In fact this film has about the longest song and dance number in history and if you aren t into this the film will quickly bore you Give me more story As a result with overblown production numbers and a weak story this film is like a steady diet of meringue it just doesn t satisfy in the long run To think this is the film that beat out A Streetcar Named Desire and A Place in the Sun for Best Picture And to make matters worse The African Queen and Ace in the Hole weren t even nominated in this category Even more amazing to me is that Ace in the Hole lost for Best Writing Screenplay to this film even though An American in Paris had hardly any story to speak of and was mostly driven by dance and song
1	Charming in every way this film is perfect if you re in the mood to feel good If you love jazz music it is a must see If you enjoy seeing loveable characters that make you smile can bring a tear to your eye and swing like there s no tomorrow this film is for you If you are looking for an intense deep heavy piece of art to be dissected and analyzed perhaps you best stick with something by Darren Aronofsky in other words reviewer djjohn lighten up don t you know a good time when you see one My only complaint is that the movie was just too darn short I guess I ll just have to watch it several more times to get my fill
0	The concept of this made for TV horror movie is ludicrous beyond words but hey it was the late s and literally all stupid horror formats were pretty damn profitable so why not exploit the idea of a satanically possessed dog The plot of Devil Dog is easy to describe to fans of the horror genre simply think of The Omen and replace the newborn baby boy with a nest of German Shepard pups Seriously I m not kidding that s what the movie is about During the opening sequence members of some kind of satanic cult buy a female dog in heat only to have it impregnated by Satan himself You d think that the Lord of Darkness has other things on His mind than to fornicate with a German Shepard and take over the world one evil puppy at the time but apparently not Exactly like little Damien in The Omen one of the puppies is taken in by model family and grows up to become a beautiful and charismatic animal But Lucky that s the dog s name is pure evil and liquidates annoying neighbors and nosy school teachers in derivative and tamely executed ways He also inflicts his malignant character on the family wife and children but he cannot force the father Richard Crenna to stick his arm into a lawnmower because he s a chosen one The whole thing becomes too moronic for words when Crenna eventually travels to Ecuador to search for an ancient wall painting and gets advice from an old witchdoctor who speaks perfect English I guess he learned that living in isolation atop of a mountain his entire life Director Curtis Harrington What s the matter with Helen Ruby and lead actor Richard Crenna Wait until Dark The Evil desperately try to create a suspenseful and mysterious atmosphere but all is in vain Scenes like cute puppy eyes spontaneously setting fire to a Spanish maid or a dog dodging bullets without even moving evoke chuckles instead of frights and not even spooky musical tunes can chance that The special effects are pathetic especially near the end when the Satan dog mutates into an utterly cheesy shadow on the wall Devil Dog is a truly dumb movie but it s definitely hilarious to watch late at night with some friends and loads of liquor There are entertaining brief cameos of Martine Beswick Dr Jekyll and Sister Hyde as the terrifying cult queen and R G Armstrong The Car The Pack as the evil fruit vegetable and puppy salesman And yes that annoying daughter is the same kid who gets blown away complaining about her ice cream in Carpenter s Assault on Precinct
1	I was about thirteen when this movie came out on television It is far superior in action than most movies since Martin Sheen is excellent and though Nick Nolte has a small part he too provides excellent support Vic Morrow as the villain is superb When Sheen tests the water in his Ford COOL along the mountainous highway it is spectacular The ending is grand I m disappointed in the low vote this received I figure the younger generations have more interest in much of the junk that is coming out these days Good taste eludes the masses
0	Bo Derek will not go down in history as a great actress On the other hand starting in the s actual acting talent seemed to be less and less of a required ability in Hollywood so Bo could very well have gone onto bigger and better things after the big box office take of Blake Edwards That is if she hadn t allowed her husband John Derek to take over her career Numerous Playboy spreads and bad movies like this one this one in particular directed by John destroyed what momentum she had and made her the butt of many a joke In the s it was assumed that you could put a certain personality in a certain movie and it would be box office gold John figured that putting Bo in a movie wherein she was nude for much of the running time would make people flock to the theaters after the hype Maybe if the movie had been any good perhaps This version of Tarzan has got to be the all time worst of the many iterpretations of Burrough s lord of the jungle a slap in the face to character s book and film legacy Tarzan is in fact an after thought as the film is primarily a vehicle for Bo s breasts and Richard Harris wonderful over acting remember the pair had worked together in Orca His scenery chewing helps you to stay awake during the boredom of it all and yes the film is quite boring Nothing really exciting happens and the few action scenes seem to have been shot by someone in a trance Bo s body can only get you so far Miles O Keeffe who played Tarzan at least would go onto a long and enjoyable B movie career and Richard Harris can put this behind him after his recent acting triumphs but Bo and John Derek never recovered from this fiasco and future collaborations between the two only served to show why his directing career and her acting career died in the first place And how did the orangutan get to Africa
1	This one is tough to watch as an earlier reviewer says That is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after WWII particularly the liberation of Dachau It is clear that as of the middle of the war we knew exactly what was happening to the Jews The sequence that shows a transport is vivid almost as if based upon an actual newsreel the Nazis liked to record their atrocities Knox as the Nazi is brilliant He charts the course of a Nazi career That charting is particularly telling when contrasted with the reactions of other Germans at first laughing at Hitler then incredulous and finally helpless That contrast however permits us to believe in the conversion of one young Nazi officer to an anti Nazi stance That did happen as witness the several attempts against Hitler most notably the Staffenberg plot which occurred as this film was coming out A strong film effectively using flashbacks accurately predicting the Nuremburg trails and others that would occur once the war ended
0	Wow my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not excepted I will try to tone this one down Lets be real No one wants to see a Chuck Norris movie where HE is not the main character There was a good fight scene at the end but the rest of the movie stank I have to wonder if old Chuck just can t hang with the best any more Has he slowed down so much that he has to turn out junk like this and hope that his reputation will carry him through the entire movie Chuck is an awesome martial artist and as we have seen from Walker Texas Ranger a fairly good actor but the trick is to combine both of these qualities in his movies and this one does not Very Disappointing for us Norris fans Chuck stay as the main character in your movies because this does not work for you Gary
1	Antonio Margheriti s Danza Macabra Castle of Blood is an eerie atmospheric chiller that succeeds on all fronts It looks absolutely beautiful in black white and it has wonderfully creepy Gothic vibe Alan Foster is an English journalist who pursues an interview with visiting American horror writer Edgar Allan Poe Poe bets Foster that he can t spend one night in the abandoned mansion of Poe s friend Thomas Blackwood Accepting the wager Foster is locked in the mansion and the horror begins The film is extremely atmospheric and it scared the hell out of me The crypt sequence is really eerie and the tension is almost unbearable Barbara Steele looks incredibly beautiful as sinister specter Elisabeth Blackwood Castle of Blood is easily one of the best Italian horror movies made in early s A masterpiece
0	When I go to see a movie about zombie s I m not expecting oscar calibre performances or writing on the level of The Godfather but I do expect the actors to at least not look like their straining to read their cue cards and dialogue that doesn t sound like it was typed out minutes before the actor reads it into the camera This movie was just awful I actually got up and left about minutes in and went next door and watched Cold Creek Manor that wasn t very good either but it seemed like Citizen Kane compared to this pile of crap On the plus side the girls were very pretty that s probably the only thing that kept me in my seat for longer than the first minutes in fact I left after the hottest one got killed there wasn t anything to hold my interest after that
1	Another Norman Lear hit detailing the problems that African Americans had to go through in the turbulent s and s With Esther Rolle and husband along with children living in a Chicago high rise project in a predominantly black neighborhood the show depicted what black people were going through with a landlord black agent Mr Bookman as well as prices and the day to day problems of just existing The children depicted how people seem to face their problems differently from the comical JJ to the militant Ralph Carter to their daughter who also aspired to attain success this show was a perfect description of African American life
0	Rumor has it that when the NASA Technical Advisors to this film were asked to keep the picture believable they laughed for several hours After all unless you are a politician or work crew the shuttle you are not going to get in the shuttle Furthermore Space Cadet Camp is in Alabama not Florida The truth is everyone on Earth will win multi billion dollar lottery prizes before the events depicted in this film ever become possible This film was meant for kids and had to have been written by one because they are not aware of the myriad restrictions and requirements regarding access to KSC CCAFS This is the most useless film of all time and it was a well deserved flop
0	Unless you understand wretched excess this movie won t really mean much to you An attempt was made to interject a bit of humanity into a cold and bleak period consumed by alcohol and drugs it doesn t work When Salma Hayak does her big disco number her voice is so obviously dubbed it is pathetic the producers could at least have gotten someone that sounded remotely like her The documentary that has been playing on television lately is far superior and gives a much truer view of that period of our history No one with the exception of Mikey Myers could be accused of acting however he does an incredible job
1	Before watching this movie I thought this movie will be great as Flashpoint because before watching this movie Flashpoint was the last Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong movie I previously watched As far as sexual scenes are concerned I was disappointed I thought sexual scenes of Dreamquest will be great as Flashpoint sexual scenes but I was disappointed Except Asia Carrera s sexual scene any sexual scene in this movie doesn t make me feel great you know what I mean The great Jenna Jameson doesn t do those kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of Felecia and Stephanie Swift both of those lovely girls disappoint me as well as far as sexual scenes are concerned Although its a adult movie but if you aside that sexual scenes factor this movie is very good If typical adult movie standards are concerned this movie definitely raised the standards of adult movies Story acting direction sets makeups and other technical stuff of this movie are really great The actors of this movie done really good acting they all done a great job Dreamquest is definitely raised the bar of quality of adult movies
1	dear god where do i begin this is bar none the best movie i ve ever seen the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best why the script writers for this movie aren t writing big budget films i will never understand another is the cast it is great this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure i know some of you out there are probably thinking no way he has plenty better but no your wrong raptor island is a work of art i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie Crash with a bunch of no names AND no raptors i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing EVER
0	This clever film was originally a Japanese film And while I assume that original film was pretty bad it was made a good bit worse when American International Films hacked the film to pieces and inserted American made segments to fool the audience Now unless your audience is made of total idiots it becomes painfully obvious that this was done and done with little finesse or care about the final product The bottom line is that you have a lot of clearly Japanese scenes and then clearly American scenes where the film looks quite different Plus the American scenes really are meaningless and consist of two different groups of people at meetings just talking about Gamera the evil flying turtle And although this is a fire breathing flying and destructive monster there is practically no energy because I assume the actors were just embarrassed by being in this wretched film in particular film veterans Brian Donlevy and Albert Dekker They both just looked tired and ill at ease for being there Now as for the monster it s not quite the standard Godzilla like creature Seeing a giant fanged turtle retract his head and limbs and begin spinning through the air like a missile is hilarious On the other hand the crappy model planes destructible balsa buildings and power plant are as usual in this film and come as no surprise Plus an odd Japanese monster movie clich is included that will frankly annoy most non Japanese audience members and that is the adorable and precocious little boy who loves the monster and believes in him Yeah right Well just like in GODZILLA VERSUS THE SMOG MONSTER and several other films you ve got this annoying creep cheering on the monster though unlike later incarnations of Godzilla Gamera is NOT a good guy and it turns out in the end the kid is just an idiot Silly exceptional poor special effects that could be done better by the average seven year old bad acting meaningless American clips and occasionally horrid voice dubbing make this a wretched film Oddly while most will surely hate this film and that stupid kid there is a small and very vocal minority that love these films and compare them to Bergman and Kurosawa Don t believe them this IS a terrible film FYI Apparently due to his terrific stage presence Gamera was featured in several more films in the s as well as some recent incarnations None of these change the central fact that he is a fire breathing flying turtle or that the movies are really really lame

1	I have decided to not believe what famous movie critics say Even though this movie did not get the best comments this movie made my day It got me thinking What a false world this is What do you do when your most loved ones deceive you It s said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance Same way some people are such that they are never grateful This movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself A brother dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster The surviving brother decides to take revenge Through this process we learn about the futility of this world Nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone Amitabh gave the performance of his life The new actor Aryan gave a good performance The actress who played the wife of Amitabh stole the show Her role was small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance Chawla had really great face expressions but her role was very limited and was not given a chance to fully express herself A great movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi His movies always give some message to the audience His movies are like novels of Nanak Singh a Punjabi novelist who s novels always had a purpose and targeted a social evil because they have a real message for the audience They are entertaining as well as lesson giving
0	This sad little film bears little similarity to the Broadway revival that was such a nostalgic hit Keep in mind that when Burt Shevelove directed that revival he rewrote the book extensively I have a feeling that this screenwriter wrought as much of a change from the original version as well I played the innocent philanderer Jimmy Smith on stage in and thought this DVD would bring back memories Not a chance Even the anticipated delight of seeing Topper Roland Young play my part was a major disappointment Three songs from the play remain and are done very poorly Even the classic duet Tea For Two is done as a virtual solo The many familiar faces in this fiasco do not do themselves proud at all and the star Anna Neagle just embarrasses herself When I feel gypped by spending a dollar I know the film must be bad Another commentator mentioned the Doris Day version which is actually called Tea For Two and is about doing the stage play the original of course so those who are seeking the true No No Nanette might find a more recognizable version there
1	Despite being told from a British perspective this is the best WW II documentary ever produced Presented in digestible as digestible as war can be episodes as the grave voice of Laurence Olivier connects the multitudes of eye witnesses who were forced to live the events of that horrific time Eagerly awaiting its appearance on DVD in the U S The Europeans had their opportunity with a release in DVD earlier this year
0	badly directed garbage a mediocre nihilist sadistic gorefest if you are the sort of person who likes that see a shrink even if you are that person it doesn t make this a good film the acting is really poor the story full of plot holes the director really should just give up and find a real job as he has no talent for this one I can see why people dislike uwe boll we have had a few of his films on lately and this is the best of them which is really sad A complete absence of any sort of humanity seems to suit some people but here it just grates Horror films can be full of desolation they can be miniature works of art they can be just good viewing when there is nothing else on SEED is just really really poor
0	Really it s a dreadful cheat of a film Its minute running time is very well padded with stock footage The rest are non descript exteriors and drab interiors scenes The plot exposition is very poorly rendered They are all just perfunctory scenes sort of strung together There is no attempt at drama in scene selection but rather drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors Please don t ask The plot concerns a rocket radiating a million degree heat orbiting earth five miles up threatening to destroy the earth It s a real time menace that must be diverted if a custom built H bomb can be fashioned and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour Nothing very much here to report except for a mad speech by a scientist against the project because there might be some sort of life aboard and think of the scientific possibilities but this speech made by the obligatory idiot liberal was pretty much pass by then What saves this film somewhat uniquely IS the stock footage I ve never seen a larger selection of fifties jet fighter aircraft in any other film This is by no means a complete list but just some of the aircraft I managed to see There s a brief interception by a pilot flying in alternate shots an F Scorpion and an F First to scramble interceptors is the Royal Canadian Air Force in Hawker Hunters and F Sabre Jets or Canadian built CF s and even a pair of CF Clunks Then for some reason there are B s B s and even B s are seen taking off More padding These Canadian jets are moving at miles an hour I don t think so since one of them appears to be a WW era Gloster Meteor the rest F s The Meteors press the attack and one turns into a late F F with a flight of early straight wing F s attacking in formation There s a strange tandem cockpit version of the F that doesn t seem to be the T training type but some sort of interim all weather interceptor variant with radar in the nose These are scrambled in a snowstorm An angled deck aircraft carrier is seen from about meters It launches F U Crusaders F F Tigers A Vigilantes and A Skywarriors The Air Force scrambles F s and F s and more F s then you ve ever seen in your life as well as F Super Sabres and F Delta Daggers The F s press their attack with sooooo much padding The F s unload their rockets in their wingtip pods in slo mo The F s fire an F lets loose a Falcon even some F s F s with mid wing rocket pods let loose There is a very strange shot of a late model F prototype with a straight wing early model F above it in a turn obviously a manufacturer s Republic Aviation advertising film showing the differences between the old and the new improved models of the F ThunderJet How it strayed into here is anybodies guess There is other great stock footage of Ottawa in the old days when the capital of Canada was a wide spot in the road and especially wonderful footage of New York City s Times Square during one of the Civil Defense Drills in the early s I think we also have to deal with the notion that this was filmed in Canada with the possible exception of the auto chase seen late in the picture as the Pacific seems to be in the background The use of a Jowett Jupiter is somewhat mind boggling and there is a nice TR to be seen also Canada must have been cheap and it is rather gratuitously used a lot in the background As far as the actual narrative of the film there is little to recommend it other than the mystery of just who Ellen Parker is giving the finger to at the end of the picture And she most definitely is flipping someone off Could it be R as in Robert Loggia The director who dies before this film was released Her career as this was her last credit Its like the newspaper the gift came wrapped in was more valuable than the gift
0	I cannot believe that this movie was ever created I think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse The zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup The zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes Finally there are maybe five or six zombies total definitely not a nation The best part of the movie if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished Again to reiterate other user comments the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie Also there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all It is never explained
1	This is real character and story driven drama at a level that shames most of what we see on TV at the mo I was impressed right from the start Don t be put off if your not a sci fi nut like me This could be happening on earth the fact that its in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting there are no space ships or laser guns None yet anyway So far I ve seen up to s e and I m gripped and wondering whats going to happen next as there are so many possibilities The cast play there roles with pasion Eric stoltz is especially strong This show really stands alone well it doesn t matter if you watched BSG or not in fact they are quite different I ve read some negative reviews from sci fi geeks who expected less drama and more aliens and ray guns etc but I would say ignore them This is a really positive start to a show Lets hope they don t cann it after or seasons like they normally do with good shows these days
0	On the surface the idea of Omen was good It s nice to see that the devil child could be a girl In fact sometimes as in the Exorcist when girls are possessed or are devilry it s very effective But in Omen it stunk Delia does not make me think that she could be a devil child rather she is a child with issues Issues that maybe only a therapist rather then a priest could help She does not look scary or devilish Rather she looks sulky and moody This film had potential and if it was made by the same people who had made the previous three films it could of worked But it s rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most favoured horror trilogies as a made for TV movie special On so many levels it lets down It s cheap looking the acting is hammish and the effects are typical of a TV drama The characters do not bring any sympathy and you do not route for them I recently re watched it after someone brought it for me for Christmas and it has dated appalling If your thinking of watching this then I would suggest that you don t Watch one of the others or watch the Exorcist or watch The Good Son Just don t waste your time on this drivel
1	G d on and Jules Naudet wanted to film a documentary about rookie New York City firefighters What they got was the only film footage inside the World Trade Center on September Having worked with James Hanlon s ladder company before Jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak while G d on stayed at the firehouse in case anything interesting happened An airplane flying low over the City distracted Jules and he pointed the camera up seconds before the plane crashed into Tower One Jules asked the captain to follow him into the Towers The first thing he saw was two people on fire something he refused to film He stayed on site for the next several hours filming reactions of the firefighters and others who were there The brothers Naudet took great care in not making the movie too violent grizzly and gory But the language from the firefighters is a little coarse and CBS showed a lot of balls airing it uncensored The brothers Naudet mixed footage they filmed with one on one interviews so the firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during particular moments of the crisis Unlike a feature film of similar title most of the money from DVD sales go to related charities Very well made emotional moving and completely devoid of political propaganda is the best documentary of the sort to date
1	Well I thoroughly enjoyed this movie It was funny and sad and yes the guy Andie MacDowell shagged was hot Interesting realistic characters and plots as well as beautiful scenery I think my Mum would like it I still think they should have been allowed to call it the Sad F kers Club though
0	I don t know what would be so great about this movie Even worse why should anyone bother seeing this one First of all there is no story One could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling laughter cry fear but in my opinion this movie does not do that either You are just watching images for hrs There are more useful things to do I guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all the above But is this worth hrs of your valuable time and EUR of your money For me the answer is no
1	This wonderful BBC television production not a movie as others have written here of the classic love story Jane Eyre starring Timothy Dalton as Rochester and Zelah Clarke as Jane is the finest version that has been made to date since it is the most faithful to the novel by Charlotte Bronte in both concept and dialogue A classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons when film producers start to meddle with a classic s very lifeblood then that classic is destroyed Thankfully the producers of THIS Jane Eyre approached the story with respect and faithfulness towards the original which results in a spectacularly addictive concoction that is worth viewing multiple times to enjoy its multi layers of sweetness and delight and suspense The performances are delightful the music is just right even the Gothic design of the house and outdoor shots are beautiful and set the right tone for the production My only criticism though slight is that this version like every other version ever made of Jane Eyre ignores the Christian influences that built Jane s character and influenced her moral choices In today s modern world a woman in Jane s situation wouldn t think twice but to stay with Rochester after finding out he had an insane wife and was still married to her Oh just get a divorce she would say to her man or she would live in sin with him But Jane Eyre knew she couldn t settle for this course in life and respect herself Why This decision was based on the foundations of the Christian faith she had been taught since childhood not from the brutal Calvinist Lowood Institution but from the Christian example of a true friend Helen Burns who was martyred rather than not turn the other cheek Someday I would like to see some version depict these influences a little more fully in an adaptation A classic novel that ends with the heroine writing Even so come Lord Jesus should not have the foundations of that faith stripped out of it
0	Wow here it finally is the action movie without action In a real low budget setting don t miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times of a future Seattle we find a no brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood There is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies mainly Matrix without having the money to do it right Yes we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot outs secs approx but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody s attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then And yes we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere as if the script was thought out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes Believe me it is as bad as it possibly can get In fact it doesn t deserve to be taken seriously but perhaps I can make some of you not rent it and save your money
1	Without being one of my favorites this is good for being a change of pace even if only for a few minutes It all starts with a big fight between Tom Jerry and Spike who is renamed Butch here They re all beating each other but suddenly Spike makes a heroic and admirable decision he stops the fight and suggests that they all should be friends So all of them sign a peace treaty and become friends which isn t going to last for long Meanwhile the three become affectionate patient and kind to each other They even save each other when one of them is in danger of life The relationship goes nothing but excellent until a very big steak appears and they all become greedy The three are guilty to return to their usual fights and rivalries But still to see Tom Jerry and Spike as friends is truly a delightful and grateful experience even if only for a while Oh by the way as a curious fact two songs from The Wizard of Oz are played here in instrumental versions We re off to see the Wizard and Somewhere over the rainbow
0	I say I d figure in that line because frankly I ve not seen a Hal Hartley movie until now It s not that I haven t heard of him though as he was seen as one of those small NY filmmakers when I say small I mean even smaller than Jim Jarmusch who made ultra personal projects on limited budgets In an ironic way much as with Pasolini s Salo though in a slightly different context Fay Grim interests me to see some of Hartley s more acclaimed features because there seems to be at least present some semblance of talent behind it as if Hartley could be a very good filmmaker who may be so good he s just taken a big experimental blunder Or on the other hand he could just be someone far too impressed with his own idiosyncrasies and would be Godard like cinematic collisions I can t quite explain the story which may or may not be a problem I suppose however it s not really in due to not having seen the film that preceded Fay Grim Henry Fool I think even if I had that experience it wouldn t make too much of a difference based on the final results There s a lot of international espionage a double plot wrapped inside of another that s fallen through the fake pockets of the title character played in an aloof way by Parker Posey not sure if that s good or bad either maybe both and also involving a CIA operative Jeff Goldblum as usual a solid presence amid the mania even conjuring some laughs not to mention an orgy laden picture box and author Henry Fool It s not that the script is totally impenetrable however much it goes into over extended loopholes just for the sake of it because there are some touches of witty or affectingly strange dialog Quite simply the direction just sucks Harltey is in love with the Third Man which is fine but he imposes a consistently headache inducing style of everything being tilted in angle with characters having to get into frame equally oddly Not since Battlefield Earth in fact has a director come off so annoyingly in trying to make the unnecessary choice of titled angles for some bizarre dramatic effect only this time Hartley isn t amid a cluster f he s mostly responsible for it This along with the crazy wannabe Godard title cards that pop in here and there some a little amusing and some just totally stupid and the montage segments all in still shots AND a couple of moments involving action that almost call to mind Ed Wood undermine any of the potential that is in the script which is already fairly hard to decipher In a way it s fascinating to watch how bad this all goes but a kind of fascination that comes in seeing the flip side to total creative control on a sort of small scale story But let it be known you ll likely not come across a more wretchedly pretentious example of American independent film making this year
1	Very nice action with an interwoven story which actually doesn t suck Interesting enough to merit watching instead of skipping past to get to the good parts Having Jenna Jameson and Asia Carrere helps liven it up too Jenna in that sweater and those glasses is just astounding Worth picking up just to see her
0	spoilers The one truly memorable part of this otherwise rather dull and tepid bit of British cuisine is Steiner s henna rinse one of the worst dye jobs ever That and the magnificent caterpillar eyebrows on the old evil dude who was trying to steal Steiner s invention MST K does an admirable job of making a wretchedly boring and grey film funny I particularly like it when Crow kills Mike with his touch of death and when he revives him in the theatre Mike cries Guys I died I saw eternal truth and beauty oh it s this movie That would be a letdown having to come back from the afterlife to watch the rest of The Projected Man The film could make a fortune being sold as a sleep aide Some of the puns in the film were wicked police inspector electrocution Crow Shocking isn t it police inspector That s LOwe all right Tom Servo Very low right down by the floor police inspector Can I get on Tom Servo He s dead but knock yourself out MST K is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer
0	In the many films I have seen Warren Oates I have come to a definite conclusion here is one talented individual I first saw Mr Oates back in the s television series called Stoney Burke From then on I followed his career closely and felt he was destined for great roles That happened in when Sam Peckinpah gave him top billing in a film called Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia Of course his biggest claim to fame was his magnificent role in The Wild Bunch I have always thought he was quite able to bring any character a certain magic that is until I saw him in this flop The movie is called Chandler a tribute to the iron fisted detectives of the s created by Raymond Chandler Because the synopsis said it was about a hard nose Private Eye I was immediately interested However I sat patiently through the entire film and found it to be a dull dis interesting slow pace twisted confusing saga which if it had a theme or plot must have been left on some dark back room self Collectively and with some of Hollywood s best supporting stars such as Alex Dreier Mitch Ryan Gordon Pinsent Charles McGraw Richard Loo and Scatman Crothers this movie had enough power to reach Mach five however it fizzled on the launchpad and went no where As a result one of my favorite actor s got stuck in a poorly made vehicle which never got off the ground
0	Opening scene explains why Hurt is later immune to the Contaminated Man Too bad it doesn t explain anything else How did he get whatever he caught what was it why does it work so fast Then we go to Present Day Budapest OK was the opener in the past or the future It turns out to be the past of course but for a minute it looks just as likely to be the nd of the movie moved to the beginning Sorry I should have paid closer attention huh Or maybe it s just badly done Then a lot of confusion about the different jobs he s had in related fields and finally a mention about how he should have died from the original experiment the n s a did on him Aha So the n s a and private industry got together to poison one of their top guys to watch the effects He must have been one of the top guys he s friends with the c e o of the Chemical company for God sakes Then there s the substance itself Technically a poison but it mutates in immune carriers so we can have whatever we want a poison a disease an allergic reaction all very different things in real life Magically it s not contagious from one dying victim to another only from the carrier How convenient Then there s the h a z m a t protocol They jump into a situation without having any idea what s in store or how prepare for it Did the producers not have enough money to show a proper wash down after the crew just left the scene of a deadly unknown substance I kept thinking Hurt was going to die from bad cleanup technique and the open scene would turn out to be the closer after all
1	Descent Yeah Boy I haven t seen anything this powerful and scintillating since Bruno Dumont s Twentynine Palms By the way this film is not to be confused with another fairly recent pic about the topic of female empowerment THE Descent directed by our Splat Pack friend Neil Marshall who also happens to be a major talent his own right But getting back to this Descent the NC rated uh oh effort on which the lovely Ms Dawson takes a producer s credit congratulations and directed by Talia Lugacy strong chance that s not a real name as good as it is in moments it will not be appreciated by most lay people out there because the script is pretty flawed As a producer you really have to tighten up that script Of course in the premise alone you have the promise of rising conflict but there still lies the task therein of accomplishing rising conflict At times this thing plays like an interesting piece of experimental theater and well I guess I ll let the others who ve already commented here speak to the boringness of it namely that which occurs in the second act but find me a second act that isn t boring There s also this Catch that goes along with these quasi independent films like Descent in which Rosario happens to be attaching herself to and leveraging her fame identity to get a script into production that would under usual circumstances not get made at all while at the same time she is basically a miscast in the film s leading role Rosario Dawson is gorgeous and apparently you can shoot this girl from just about any angle all day long but oh wow wee how fast the time just slips away Rosy ain t no undergraduate no more That s part of the confusion about the screenplay Is she a graduate student A TA No graduate students don t really have these type of qualms with football players do they Again if you are Rosario Dawson Executive Producer that s the one of many many aspects to the professional film process you ll have to think about as you embark on this wonderful new role in your film career And if you don t have the answer to why you re movie isn t convincing let me tell you there is a boatload and a bevy of vivacious well qualified undergraduate aged talents pining to get involved in the business who might have nailed that lead character down all the while looking just as darn good as you know who but unfortunately without Ms Dawson no Honey NO money I have to say the camera department did an outstanding job however because this film is really well shot i e lit in all its dreary dreamy darkness The nightclub scenes look wonderful one can tell all those music videos are starting to pay off and the play with time The shooting framing is all quite excellent which makes the picture a rewarding watch Descent is good not great However I have a feeling thanks to NetFlix this movie will find a life of its own I hope this group continues making films If you re into experimental American film making cinematographic imagery of implausibly well formed college studs or male model drop outs in their early twenties or if you re an undergraduate just plain angry at the hormonally aggressive young men that comprise less than half of your American university Rosario Dawson s Descent might be your flavor of RockaRoll
1	Ashanti is a very s sort of film to be precise It reminded me of The Wild Geese in a way Richard Burton Richard Harris and Roger Moore on a mission in Africa It s a very good film too and I enjoyed it a lot David Michael Caine is a doctor working in Africa and is married to a beautiful Ashanti woman called Anansa Beverley Johnson who has trained in medicine in America and is also a doctor While they re doctoring one day she is snatched by slavers working for an Arabic slave trader called Suleiman played perfectly by Peter Ustinov of all people The rest of the film is David trying to get her back Michael Caine is a brilliant actor of course and plays a character who is very determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff He s helped out first by a Englishman campaigning against the slave trade that no one acknowledges is going on Rex Harrison then briefly by a helicopter pilot William Holden and then by an Arab called Malik Kabir Bedi Malik has a score to settle with Suleiman he is very intense throughout a very engaging character and so rides off with David to find him and get Anansa back this involves a wonderful scene in which David fails miserably to get on his camel Then there s lots of adventure There s also lots of morality questioning The progress of the story is a little predictable from this point and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move things along faster but it s all pretty forgivable The question is will David get to Anansa before Peter Ustinov sells her on to Omar Sharif yes of course Omar Sharif is in it
1	out of This is a truly wonderful story about a wartime evacuee and a curmudgeonly carpenter Tom Oakley The boy William Beech is billeted with Tom and it is immediately apparent that he has serious issues when he wets his bed on the first night William is illiterate and frightened but somehow the two find solace in each others loneliness It transpires that William has a talent as an artist and we see Tom s talent as a choirmaster in an amusing rendition of Jerusalem William is befriended by Zacharias Wrench a young Jewish lad also from London and along with both Tom and Zacharias he finally learns to read and write and to feel a part of this small close knit community Just as he is settling down William is recalled back to London by his mother and it is here we see why he is so screwed up His mother is clearly mentally sick and when Tom doesn t hear from William he travels to London to look for him He finally finds him holding his dead baby sister where he has been tied up in a cellar After a period in hospital Tom realises he must kidnap him and take him home with him The climax is a bitter sweet ending when William is told he is to be adopted by Tom while at the same time learning his best friend Zacharias has been killed in an air raid in London For me one of the most moving scenes was when Tom was talking to a official from the Home Office I love im an for what it s worth I think he loves me too It just doesn t get better that that does it

0	Holy crap this movie was bad I watched it just as a joke It isn t even so bad that it s good in an unintentional way This film seemed to be designed to personally make me angry It worked really well at doing that It s as if the people who made this just took all of the really annoying stuff about the movie PRIEST added in a bunch of ugly dudes took out anything interesting funny or even remotely sexy and clever out of the concoction and then added in a bunch of old rotten cheese That s all this is Cheese There isn t a single person this film could possibly connect to There isn t any universe this film could possibly take place in Why can t a film like this just be about enjoying life and being happy Why did they have to make this already stupid idea for a film even more ridiculous than it already is Why couldn t they at least even tried to make it an okay film or even a B movie Now that I think of it what they hell were they trying to do with this film I watched it expecting a campy love story and instead I got some boring student project about some idiot who has to find the strength and courage to marry his boyfriend while his annoying Christian brother tried to destroy it all No I m not joking That s what it s about Does that sound good This film is pretty ignorant against people of the Christan religion with it s stereotyping of all Christians being loudmouthed rude and hellbent on making as many people as miserable as possible A lot of Christian people I know would never speak or act like these freaks The film however is just as unfair and ignorant to the gay community as well These have got to be the most tastelessly crafted stereotypical gay men since the guy on the radio station on that ROADKILL video game It s so nerve wracking and simply irritating to the point that I wasn t able to fully pay attention to this film The makers of this train wreck had no strategy for set design acting camera angles lighting script authenticity or an idea to make this entertaining or interesting There isn t even a single sex scene or at least not a believable one Jamie Brett Gabel was the only guy in the film that looked any good at all but his good looks were sadly put to waste This is trash In a perfect world this film would get voted a It s worth as a film alone A mentally handicapped nun who is blind deaf and has tiny little bones for arms and legs and whose face is located on her armpit could write direct and produce a better film and she d probably be a better actor as well the fact that this film exists is a crime against the word film itself This film is so bad that other films should be ashamed of being available in the same watchable format I could put a broom in a chair and then record it with a camera and then stop the film and then replace it with a mini x mas tree and then record that and I ve already made a film that will always be better than BEN ARTHUR by at least half There are only two things worse than death Torture and watching BEN ARTHUR I m a homosexual and I will probably be the gayest person you will ever meet if you ever met me and I don t think I ve ever been more offended by an entire film than I was by the first five seconds of this film alone If this movie was a mistake I will personally find a way to change the famous phrase It s okay to make mistakes to It s okay to make mistakes unless that mistake was BEN ARTHUR You know how people always say things like Good things come out of everything I think that BEN ARTHUR was primarily invented so that there could be something on this earth that nothing good would ever come out of To call this movie the worst movie I ve ever seen would be giving it WAY too much credit It s as if this film were designed just so that it could qualify in a category of it s very own There are good movies there are bad movies and then there s BEN ARTHUR This is BEN AND ARTHUR
1	Shannon Lee the daughter of Bruce Lee delivers high kicking martial arts action in spades in this exhilarating Hong Kong movie and proves that like her late brother Brandon she is a real chip off the old block There is high tech stuntwork to die for in this fast paced flick and the makers of the Bond movies should give it a look if they want to spice up the action quotient of the next adventure as there is much innovative stuff here with some fresh and original second unit work to bolster up the already high action content of AND NOW YOU RE DEAD When you watch a movie as fast paced and entertaining as this you begin to wonder how cinema itself was able to survive before the martial arts genre was created I genuinely believe that movies in general and action movies in particular were just marking time until the first kung fu movies made their debut Bruce Lee was the father of modern action cinema and his legitimate surviving offspring Shannon does not let the family name down here Although there are several pleasing performances in this movie Michel Wong for one it is Shannon Lee whom you will remember for a genuinely spectacular performance as Mandy the hitgirl supreme Hell you may well come away whistling her fights
0	I was babysitting a family of three small children for a night and their mother gave me this to show for them having just grabbed it at Wal Mart earlier in the week All three children actually got physically ill while watching it I m pretty sure it was the pizza they ate or something they all had picked up from school but really it could have been this film Absolutely disgusting How any one can produce this caliber of trash is beyond me Fortunately I turned off the film when I noticed the children were not responding and acting strangely For any parents out there I strongly advise you to refrain from letting young children view this movie
1	Dark Remains is a home run plain and simple The film is full of creepy visuals and scares that will make the most seasoned horror veteran jump straight out of there seat The staircase scene in particular these guys are good Although they weren t working on a huge budget everything looks good and the actors come through Dark Remains does have one of those interpretive endings which may be a negative for some but I guess it makes you think Cheri Christian and Greg Thompson are spot on as the grieving couple trying to rebuild there lives however some side characters like the Sheriff didn t convince me They aren t all that important anyways I give Dark Remains a perfect ten rating for being ten times scarier than any recent studio ghost story Japanese remake
1	The movie was very moving It was tender and funny at the same time The scenery was absolutely beautiful Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser gave award winning performances Olympia Dukakis was great I understand due to the story line her part had to be brief but I did wish I could have seen more of her she is a true pro You will be able to recall experiences from your own life hopefully in a positive way after seeing this movie We were fortunate to see Paul Reiser at a Q and A after the viewing He is a wonderful man clever eloquent and a real Person It was truly an enjoyable night out This is a must see movie You will be so grateful you went
1	I work at a movie store and as such I am always on the look out for an excellent movie I decided to check out Nothing as it sat in our Canadian section and I ve been trying to support my country s movie industry I was in for a surprise The film features David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and relationships without working that hard It is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters as well as some funny exchanges We can t be dead we have cable What more can I say without noting that it is worth a shot even if you abandon it within the first half an hour
0	Loved the original story had very high expectations for the film especially since Barker was raving about it in interviews finally saw it and what can I say It was a total MESS The directing is all over the place the acting was atrocious the flashy visuals and choreography were just flat empty and completely unnecessary whats up with the generic music video techniques like the fast forward slow mo nonsense It was stylish yes but not needed in this film and cheapened the vibe into some dumb MTV Marilyn Manson Smashing Pumpkins Placebo music video Whilst some of the kills are pretty cool and brutal some are just ridiculously laughable the first kill on the Japanese girl was hilarious and Ted Raimi s death was just stupidly funny It just rushes all over the place with zero tension and suspense totally moving away from the original story and then going back to it in the finale which by that point just feels tacked on to mess it up even more No explanations were given whatsoever I mean I knew what was happening only as i d read the story but for people who hadn t it s even more confusing as at times even i didn t know where it was going and what it was trying to do it was going on an insane tangent the whole time God I really wanted to like this film as i m a huge fan of Barker s work and loved the story as it has immense potential for a cracking movie hell I even enjoyed some of Kitamura s movies as fun romps but this film just reeked of amateurism and silliness from start to finish I didn t care about anyone or anything the whole thing was rushed and severely cut down from the actual source turning it into something else entirely Granted it was gory and Vinnie Jones played a superb badass but everything else was all over the place more than disappointing Gutted
1	Rated R for Strong Language Violent Content and Some Nudity Quebec Rating Canadian Home Video Rating AFear Of A Black Hat is one of the funniest most original comedies I have ever seen Its basically a gangsta rap version of the film This Is Spinal Tap Its a shame not many people have heard of this gem of a film If you manage to find this film anywhere don t hesitate to buy it even if you don t like rap music There are not too many comedy films that I give a perfect to The only ones I can think of at the moment are this film Clerks The World According To Garp The Year Old Virgin and Chasing Amy This film is a hilarious stereotype of the gangsta rap culture The movie is about a woman named Nina Blackburn who is making a documentary about the fictional rap group N W H N z with hats They are basically the stereotype of a rap group making many controversial rap songs about killing and being a gangsta Fear Of A Black Hat is an excellent comedic film and I recommend it even if you are not a fan of the gangsta rap scene Its a shame this film is not in the Top Runtime min

0	It s Two years after the Iranian Embassy Siege which involved the dramatic SAS Rescue from the Balconys and with a War with Argentina over the Falkland Islands currently taking place what better film to make than a Gung Ho SAS Film that re creates the Iranian Hostage siege whilst using Britains Number one action hero of the day Lewis Collins throw in Edward Woodward and a few other Well known actors and you ve got a winner on your hands Well maybe not The film itself doesn t make the situation serious enough whilst the acting is quite second rate it s like a Movie long episode of The Professionals but without the formula This film goes nowhere fast and is quite predictable Maybe Cubby Brocoli watched this film and decided to ditch Lewis Collins as a Touted James Bond Replacement for Roger Moore Watch it if your a fan of Lewis Collins or SAS stuff in General if not save your time
0	This adaptation positively butchers a classic which is beloved for its subtlety Timothy Dalton has absolutely no conception of the different nuances of Rochester s character I get the feeling he never even read the book just sauntered on set in his too tight breeches and was handed a character summary that read Grumpy broody murky past He plays Rochester not as a character or as a real person but as an over the top grouch who never cracks a smile until after he gets engaged at which point he miraculously morphs into a pansy There is no chemistry The only feeling that this adaptation excited in me was incredulity and also sympathy for Charlotte Bronte who is most definitely turning in her grave GO AND REREAD THE BOOK ROCHESTER HAS A PERSONALITY AND BY THE WAY A PASSIONATE LOVE SCENE DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE TO EAT HER FACE
0	Nintendo YOU ERS How could you do this to me I can t believe it this movie is actually worse than the first one I went to see this at the theatre with my brother because my mother forced me to tag along oh God where do I even begin The plot SUCKED The voice acting SUCKED The animation SUCKED The ending REALLY SUCKED If you liked this movie YOU SUCK TOO And to Futuramafan who said this was the greatest movie ever you are a TOOL PLAIN AND SIMPLE This isn t a movie for anyone but crack addled ten year olds with Game Boys who think Pikachu is God I m still cry to this day thinking about that horrible turd of a movie and then there was Pikachu s Adventure don t even get me started on that horrible mess of a film It is in all truth one of the most boring experiences of my entire life Don t go watch this at any costs Bottom Line Go out find every copy of this movie that you can and burn it Burn them all and then proceed to rent a GOOD movie like Aliens or Bowling For Columbine or even Back to the Future
1	Never realized that Charles Boyer Luis Denard appeared with Lauren Bacall Rose Cullen in a film together and enjoyed their great acting together Even Peter Lorre Contreras had a role in this film and had a bad misfortune in his bathroom that caused him to faint This story deals with a Republican Courier Luis Denard who visits England during the Spanish Civil War and tries to disrupt a coal mining contract that will cause great harm to other nations Lauren Bacall Rose Cullen comes to the aid of Luis Denard by picking him up and at the same time falling in love with him and then proceeds to help him escape from an angry crowd of English Mine Workers who threaten his life The real bad guy in this film is Victor Francen Licata Beast with Five Fingers who gives an outstanding performance Great Classic film without Humphrey Bogart
1	This movie i ve loved since i was young Its excellent Although it may be a bit much for the average movie watcher if one can t interpret certain subtleties in the film for example our hero s name is Achilles and in the final battle between him and Alexander he s shot in the heel with a rocket just as Achilles in mythology was shot in his heel That s a just a little fact that is kind of amusing Anyway great movie good story it d be neat to see it redone with today s special effects Oddly enough Gary Graham had average success starring in the T V show Alien Nation This movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated
1	This movie was great and I would like to buy it The boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle the boy has to feed and care for the eagle until it is old enough to be sacrificed for the crops the boy saves the eagle from being killed and runs away from the tribe The eagle helps feed him by catching a duck from a small pond the boy scares up Later the boy shoots a deer that a bully kid was claiming because their arrows were marked very close the same Only until they check the thickness of the red lines do they determine who actually got the deer But this was unfortunate because it made the other boys even crueler to him and at the end he is being chased up onto a cliff but when you think he will fall off his pure love for the eagle transforms him into a golden eagle with only a necklace as a reminder of who he was Please if anyone knows where I can buy this movie let me know I haven t seen it for over years but still remember parts of the movie deniselacey yahoo com
1	This is a strong movie from a historical and epic perspective While the story is simple it is pure and straightforward In truth it is the standard story of a simple honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and wealthier men of the period Poor vs Rich honorable vs dishonorable a classic but well told tale without much of the glitz of hollywood stinking up the screen Extra points just because you can almost smell the people on the screen
0	Christopher Lambert is annoying and disappointing in his portrayal as GIDEON This movie could have been a classic had Lambert performed as well as Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump or Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt in RAIN MAN or Sean Penn as Sam Dawson in I AM SAM Too bad because the story line is meaningful to us in life the supporting performances by Charlton Heston Carroll O Connor Shirley Jones Mike Connors and Shelley Winters were excelent of
1	There s something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in can be head and shoulders above every Tarzan movie that followed it including the bloated and boring s piece Greystoke Once the viewer gets past the first three scenes which are admittedly dull Tarzan and his Mate takes off like a shot offering non stop action humor and romance Maureen O Sullivan is charming and beautiful as Jane and walks off with the movie Weismuller is solid as well Highly recommended
1	Last year we were treated to two movies about Truman Capote writing the book from which this film was made Capote and Infamous I cannot imagine a movie like this being made in A stark powerful and chillingly brutal drama elevated to the status of a film classic by the masterful direction of Richard Brooks Elmer Gantry Cat on a Hot Tin Roof The professional Blackboard Jungle It is interesting that Robert Blake who starred in this film has had so many problems of late that may be related to his portrayal of a killer in this film This is a film that stays with you after viewing
1	This is probably one of the worst movies ever made It s terrible But it s so good It s probably best if you don t watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining because you re going to be disappointed However if you want to watch it so you can see million vases and Goro s fantastic hair bad English you re in for a real treat The harder you think about the film the worse it gets unless you re having a competition to spot the most plot holes screw ups in which case you ve got hours of entertainment ahead I d only really recommend this film for the bored or the die hard Smap fans And even then the latter should be a bit careful because Goro s Japanese fans were a bit upset about it they thought he was selling himself out He wasn t really not when Johnny Kitagawa who was the executive producer can do that for him
0	Spoilers and extreme bashing lay ahead When this show first started I found it tolerable and fun Fairly Oddparents was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked It also had high ratings along with Spongebob But it started to fall because of the following crap that Butch Hartman and his team shoved into the show First off toilet humor isn t all that funny You can easily pull off a fast laugh from a little kiddie with a burp but that s pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a clich joke Next there are the kiddie jokes Lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people cross dressing LOLOLOL I just can t stop laughing at such gay bliss Somebody help me But of course this show wouldn t suck that bad if it weren t for stereotypes Did you see how the team portrayed Australians They saw them as nothing but kangaroo loving boomerang throwing simpletons who live in a hot desert But now Is the coup de grace of WHY this show truly sucks the loudest of them all OVER USED JOKES The show constantly pulls up the same jokes the majority of them being unfunny thinking it is like the greatest thing ever Cosmo is mostly the one to blame I hated how they kept on mentioning Super Toilet which also has a blend of kiddish humor in it just as well and Cosmo would freak out And who could forget that dumb battery ram joke that every goddamn parent in Dimmsdale would use in that one e mail episode You know the one in which every single parent oblivious to other parents saying it would utter the EXACT same sentence before breaking into their kid s room Yes it may be first class humor to some people but it is pure s to others If I m not mistaken I do believe Butch Hartman said something about ending the show Thank God Everyone around my area says it s like the funniest Nickelodeon show ever I just can t agree with it I think it s just another pile of horse dung that we get on our cartoon stations everyday only worse
1	This movie is one of the sleepers of all time I gave it a rating The story is of the famed Bushwhackers out of Missouri that fought on the side of the South during the War Between the States The clothing they wore were authentic the history and why they fought is very accurate and well researched There was actually one of the battles that did not take place as they depicted but not bad for Hollywood The actors were well cast and were either the most brilliant of actors or the director really know how to get the best from them I suspect it was a combination of great directing super casting to find the right people and excellent performing by the actors Not just one or two this movie really jelled It has action romance suspense good guys and bad guys sometimes depending on your individual perspective and history all rolled into one movie Even has the future Spiderman and Jewel And she s good
1	The world is a terrible place But this movie is farce and it s fun And if you don t like it you don t get it and if you don t get it doesn t matter It s up to you if you want to play along Every actor in this one had fun It s only a joke And that s good enough for me Gabriel Byrne is priceless Byrne and Paul Anka doing MY WAY is as Vic puts it the best version ever Okay it s no masterpiece but it s not bad I was warned against seeing it but I m sure glad I did
0	Robin Williams gave a fine performance in The Night Listener as did the other cast members However the movie seems rushed and leaves too many loose ends to be considered a must see I think the problem happens because there isn t a strong enough relationship established between the caller and the Gabriel Noon I had to spell it this way because IMDb wants to auto correct the right spelling to No one character The movie runs a little over and within the first minutes or so it seems Noon begins his search for Pete Logande the boy caller This happens after he talks to the mysterious caller about or times The conversations aren t too in depth mostly consisting of how are you I m in the hospital why did you boyfriend move out etc In the book the kid almost becomes Noon s shrink and vice versa and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy once he finds out the kid disappears and thinks he might be a hoax In the movie Noon becomes obsessed with finding Logande but the audience is left to wonder why Since there really isn t a strong enough bond established between Noon and the caller why bother Who cares if the caller doesn t exist I know there s a difference between a book and a movie but those calls and that relationship was critical to establish on screen because it provides the foundation for the rest of the movie Since it doesn t the movie falls apart This is surprising because of Maupin s other work Tales of the City When it was made into a mini series it worked beautifully
0	I am a lover of B movies give me a genetically mutated bat and I am in heaven These movies are good for making you stop thinking of everything else going on in your world Even a stupid B movie will usually make me laugh and I will still consider it a good thing Then there was Hammerhead which was so awful I had to register with IMDb so I could warn others First there was the science of creating the shark man which the movie barely touched on In order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes During one attack scene the camera moved off of the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being thrown by a stagehand to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead what fabulous special effects Back to the science I thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were held naked and the testing equipment required that they be monitored through their breast tissue Anyway this movie had poor plot development terrible story and I m sorry to say pretty bad acting Not even William Forsythe Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs could save this stinker
1	This movie was excellent I was not expecting it to live up to all the hype but it did Like all the Bourne movies the action is fast paced realistic and intense If you liked the other two movies in the trilogy you will love this one also The movie s plot is straightforward and there are no plot twists that are too unrealistic OK Julia Stiles character showing up in the Italian safe house was kind of far fetched especially after what happened in Supremacy but it makes sense that she is the only character in Treadstone that Bourne knows that does not want him dead and he could possibly trust and the only person to lead him in the right direction The action is driven by characters and their reactions to what is happening all around them The thing that I always loved about the Bourne movies is that Bourne can kick butt but when matched with people as good as he is the fights are struggles and he takes a lot of damage in them They never treat the audience like idiots All the actors were solid in their performances I believe that Damon could play Bourne in his sleep and receives excellent support from Joan Allen reprising her role from Supremacy David Strathairn and Scott Glenn I recommend this film and the trilogy I do miss Franka Potente though
1	If you loved Deep Cover you might like this film as well Many of the poetic interludes Fishburne recites in Deep Cover are from the lyrical script of Once In the Life a screen adaptation of a play that Fishburne wrote If you love Larry as much as I do you ll love this film that is all Larry all hot and all fleshed out Of course there is gun play and illicit substance use this is a gangster movie of sorts after all but the script is beautiful and the story is touching even a little on the chick flick side AMAZING film dark frightening sexy and exciting If you ever sneaked out at night or hung out in a clubhouse you ll get the proper impact of the cramped sets metephorically echoing being trapped in the life Full of clever foreshadowing and complex relationships this film is tight every sentiment mirrored in the set dressing and camera shots GOOD WORK
1	Finally a thriller which omits the car chases explosions and other eye catching effects The movie combines a simple plot assasination of a french president with an excellent background It takes a look behind mans behavior with authorities and explains why we would obey almost every order even murder which would be given to us Furthermore it shows us how secret services can manipulate the run of history and how hardly they can be controlled The best thing on this movie is that there is no classic Hollywood end which can easily be predicted
1	WOW This film is the best living testament I think of what happened on in NYC compared to anything shown by the major media outlets Those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside This film shows you what happened on the INSIDE It begins with a focus on a rookie New York fireman waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight The subject matter turns abruptly with the ONLY EXISTING FOOTAGE OF THE FIRST PLANE TO HIT THE TOWERS You are then given a front row seat as firefighters rush to the scene into the lobby of Tower One In the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane and Tower Two s subsequent fall you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby It is a sight you will not soon forget Heart rending tear jerking and very compelling from the first minute to the last deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made We must never forget
1	The villian in this movie is one mean sob and he seems to enjoy what he is doing that is what I guess makes him so mean I don t think most men will like this movie especially if they ever cheated on their wife This is one of those movies that pretty much stays pretty mean to the very end But then there you have it a candy bar ending that makes me look back and say HOKIE AS HELL A pretty good movie until the end Ending is the ending we would like to see but not the ending to such a mean beginning And then there is the aftermath of what happened Guess you can make up your own mind about the true ending I m left feeling that only one character should have survived at the end
0	I was browsing through Netflix and stumbled upon this movie Having fond memories of the book as a child I decided to check this out This is a movie that you should really pass on It is just not worth seeing It is very boring and uninteresting I feel that it would even be that way to small children It has no magic that the book contains This movie is not horrible but you will just find yourself not caring ten minutes into it There are moments that just come off as weird The witch character is not very good The family acts like it is no big deal that these odd things are happening I know this is a kids movie so as an older audience we must not look too deeply in things but the whole movie just feels like it was written and produced by people who have never had any movie making experience before The DVD that I had began skipping in the final moments of the film and instead of trying to fix it I just turned it off and sent it back to Netflix I really didn t care how it finished Skip this film and read the book instead
1	It s wonderful to see that Shane Meadows is already exerting international influence LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDANT shares many themes with A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS the vague class identity above working but well below middle the unhinged father the abandoned urban milieu the sense of adult failure the barely concealed fascism underpinning modern urban life But if Meadows is an expert formalist Mariage trades in images and his coolly composed exquisitely Surreal monochrome frames serve to distance the grimy and rather bleak subject matter which Meadows like veers from high farce to tragedy within seconds There are longueurs and cliches but Poelvoorde is compellingly mad an ordinary man with ordinary ambitions whose attempts to realise them are hatstand dangerous while individual set pieces the popcorn pidgeon explosions the best marriage sequence since THE DEAD AND THE DEADLY manage to snatch epiphany from despair
0	This movie s one of my favorites It s not really any good but it s great to laugh at The dialogue can become incredibly ludicrous and poorly acted eg Manji can we ask you a few questions Sure We think you can help us with the answers Any fighting is more or less surrealistic Make sure to watch for Brock the oafy white guy who attacks the main characters He only has two lines but he s one of the best guys in the movie
0	Let s see I m trying to practice finding the positive in everything so what kind thing can I say about the Pallbearer I know The performances were no that won t work as they succeeded in draining all personality from Gwyneth Paltrow usually so vibrant and ended up creating caricatures out of Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey Oh how bout the story nope That isn t gonna fly either as it was doze inducing What was the genre anyway It wasn t funny that rules out comedy It wasn t interesting enough to be dramatic Was that a romance between Schwimmer and Paltrow I have to ask as I can t be sure let s just call it losers in like I m sure those behind this film started with a vision I mean they must have had one to pitch to the studio suits but I need help finding it Even if I were a patient person who could forgive the pure stupidity of the story I couldn t in good conscience recommend a film that allows a guy to go into a professional job interview in a windbreaker and messy fluffy stupid hair Speaking of hair are we supposed to be amused by the deliberate black roots and platinum locks worn by Hershey What am I doing I already lost irretrievable minutes in the actual watching of the movie I cannot devote any more time to this loser
0	I m not sure if Carpenter is looking to raise questions on abortion and make the really heavy handed and obvious point that a woman should be allowed an abortion if Satan is the father but it drags on and on Ron Perlman is laughable The baby is really stupid looking basically a crab with a baby head mounted on it You can pretty much see the material on the Satan costume What a mess This episode has about five minutes of story and minutes of tedium Very very bad And the ending is just ridiculous After learning his baby is dead does the devil destroy the abortion clinic and kill everyone in a huge bloody gory uproar NO He just puts his head down and sulks out of the room Terrible
0	WARNING Possible spoilers belowThe film is more boring then anything else There seems to be some attempt to build tension through badly lit shots of empty rooms and empty lawns but none of it works MST K did a fairly good job with it but on its own the movie is mostly tedious Funny moments When the fake skull rolls out of a pile of ashes the wife becomes hysterical and woozy while the husband who is trying to drive the wife crazy says in a deadpan voice There is no skull there there s no skull When the real ghost skulls have the husband caught in a pickle as if trapped between first and second base
0	Before Stan Laurel became the smaller half of the all time greatest comedy team he laboured under contract to Broncho Billy Anderson in a series of cheapies many of which were parodies of major Hollywood features Following a dispute with Anderson Laurel continued the informal series of parodies at Joe Rock s smaller and more indigent production company Most of Laurel s parody films were only mildly funny at the time and even less funny for modern audiences who haven t seen the original movie which Laurel is parodying West of Hot Dog is a fairly generic parody of cowboy shoot em ups It s marginally a specific parody of West of the Pecos an oater released two years earlier with no major actors Since West of the Pecos was never a huge success it s difficult to see why Stan s film unit chose this particular movie as a target for their lampoonery much less why they waited so long after its release to parody it And where did they get that title West of Hot Dog Possibly it s down to the fact that Hot dog was a sexual interjection favoured by American lechers in the s As in the opening scene of the stage play Machinal West of Hot Dog was produced and co directed by Joe Rock Among his many other achievements Rock introduced Laurel to Lois Neilson and he was subsequently best man at their wedding Full disclosure In the last years of his life I had the great privilege of befriending Joe Rock and interviewing him Nearly ninety years old at the time Rock s memory was impressively clear but he remembered nothing at all about West of Hot Dog and I can t blame him This movie is eminently forgettable The leading lady s character is named Little Mustard If that s meant to be a parody of something in West of the Pecos I don t get it There are a couple of impossible gags here including Laurel s method for mounting a horse For just one moment in this movie Stan Laurel reminded me of the great Buster Keaton when he suddenly broke into a run West of Hot Dog is vaguely similar in subject matter and tone to Keaton s short comedy The Frozen North but Keaton s version is much funnier The plot of this film somewhat anticipates a situation in Keaton s feature Our Hospitality but again suffers by comparison here two tough varmint brothers expect to inherit the Last Chance Saloon but the previous owner has bequeathed it to weakling tenderfoot Stan However the brothers will become the legal heirs if Stan dies Hmmm Seriously though is such a bequest legal As soon as Stan takes possession of the property surely any further questions of ownership or inheritance become his decision not the previous owner s decision I had plenty of time to consider such points of law while watching this dull comedy At one point a gag involves some crude animation drawn directly onto the film stock It looks cheap and isn t funny This Hot Dog is no weiner and no winner it s just a whiner My rating one point out of Hang on Stan in a few more years you ll be one half of a comedy legend
1	The basic hook here is Lincoln Is Slow It is his slowness that represents his thoughtfulness and deliberation making him a Great Leader who is here engaged in single handedly civilizing the American frontier through the grand instrument of Law All that John Ford hooey and more including one lurking slave and extraneous Death By Injun However The slow conceit is also at the center of one brilliant piece of movie making funny and moving at extremes The history may be bunk but the telling of it suggests a view of history as process that inspires some excitingly true seeming moments Check out Henry Fonda s big introductory stroll across the deck his shockingly beautiful second visit with his girl by the river his dalliance with Mary Todd on the porch and the priceless business that follows Ma am we ve got to hurry Things do thin out once we settle into the big courtroom drama but Fonda is priceless throughout
1	After a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted urban turn of the century Australian street we meet Julie Rebecca Gibney and Peter John Adam as they go out house hunting They manage to get a loan for a fixer upper on a posh Sydney street but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home It just may be haunted Gantry Row combines a memorable if somewhat clich d story with good to average direction by Catherine Millar into a slightly above average shocker The biggest flaws seem partially due to budget but not wholly excusable to that hurdle A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film The opening thriller scene features some wonky editing Freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there s not much action Suspense should be created from staging not fancy fix it in the mix techniques There is great atmosphere in the scene from the location the lighting the fog and such but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street showing their increasing proximity The tracking and the cuts need to be slow The attack needed to be longer clearer and better blocked As it stands the scene has a strong made for television feel and a low budget one at that After this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves The story has a lot of similarities to The Amityville Horror though the budget forces a much subtler approach Millar and scriptwriter Tony Morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios often dramatic in nature instead of special effects oriented such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall For some horror fans the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama At least the first half hour of the film is primarily about Julie and Peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in But Morphett writes fine intelligent dialogue The material is done well enough that it s often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later especially if you ve gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house Once they get settled and things begin to get weirder even though the special effects often leave much to be desired the ideas are good The performances help create tension There isn t an abundance of death and destruction in the film there s more of an abundance of home repair nightmares But neither menace is really the point The point is human relationships There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting The house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it That it s in a posh neighborhood and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe such as money or health problems Peter s character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal work based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful At the same time we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be Julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship Although Gantry Row never quite transcends its made for television clunkiness as a TV movie this is a pretty good one with admirable ambitions Anyone fond of haunted house films psycho films or horror thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy It certainly isn t worth spending for a DVD that was the price my local PBS station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it factoring in shipping and handling but it s worth a rental and it s definitely worth watching for free
1	This is an excellent film dealing with a potentially exploitative subject with great sensitivity Anne Reid previously best known in the UK for her TV roles including Dinnerladies a Victoria Wood scripted series on in company catering workers if you re wondering gives a performance of finely judged understatement as May a late s bereaved mother of two chattering class adults in an inner London borough Her husband Toots Peter Vaughan dies on their visit to the male of the latter species Bobby and we see the pair being rather casually greeted by Bobby and his family May s teacher daughter Paula Cathryn Bradshaw lives nearby however and the relationship between May and Paula initially appears closer Thus when May decides she cannot live in her own home and comes back to London she is able to stay in Paula s house and do some child minding of Paula s more appreciative offspring It is on May s visits to Bobby s house that she embarks on an affair with Darren a mid s friend of Bobby who is working on a house extension In what may be the first mainstream British film to so portray it it is May and not Darren Daniel Craig who initiates the encounter and at least to begin with it seems that the relationship is founded on mutual respect There is no explicit sexual content at least in the DVD I saw differences in the IMDb cast list suggests the existence of other versions and the physical basis of the affair is handled directly but not exploitatively More strongly portrayed is the relationship between May and daughter Paula a recent convert to therapy and self exploration who announces that mummy has never been supportive of her Paula is also Darren s lover and when she finds May s explicit but rather poor drawings of Darren and May together things go downhill in dramatic but controlled fashion Only in an English film perhaps could a daughter announce that she is going to hit her mother politely ask her to stand up and duly wallop her In the mean time May is being drawn into a putative relationship with a decent but older of her own generation member of Paula s writing group The contrast between the ensuing unwanted intercourse and her affair with Darren is clearly made it is at that point that May starts to acquiesce to Paula and Darren s worm begins to turn he reveals on cocaine that he may have been after her money if not all along but for some of the ride So May finds herself superfluous to both of her children s needs and finally does return home but later leaves on a jet plane for pastures new The film s strength is that it portrays with unflinching but sympathetic truth the nature of contemporary adult parent sibling relationships where bereavement may leave the surviving parent feeling more alone than if they had no one to care for them This is not new but the openness of the portrayal of sexual need in the over s may well be The darkness of the film s content from a screenplay by Hanif Kureishi stands in contrast to the way in which it is lit it seems to be perpetual summer and the overall mood is uplifting it could so easily have been yet another piece set in a dour and rainy England The ending is perhaps under written as we don t know where May is going or for how long perhaps she s Shirley Valentine with a pension she s certainly no Picasso Anne Reid is however revealed as a fine actor whose professional life will surely have changed forever Like Julie Andrews in Torn Curtain said by Paul Newman There goes your Mary Poppins read Dinnerladies image for good Yes he announced Oct as the new James Bond
0	I first saw this when it was picked as a suggestion from my TiVo system I like Danny Elfman and thought it might be interesting On top of that I m a fan of Max Fleischer s work and this started out with the look and feel of his s cartoon With both of those I thought it would hold my interest I was wrong Just a few minutes in and I had the fast forward button down I ran through it in about minutes and thought that was it Afterwards I read some of the other reviews here and figured I didn t give it enough of a chance I recorded it again and watched it through There s minutes of my life I m not getting back I can t believe there aren t more bad reviews Personally I think it s because it s hard to get to the line comment minimum How many ways are there to say this is a waste of time The movie comes across as though it was made by a few junior high kids ready to outrage the world and thinking they can with breasts profanity and puke jokes The characters are flat The parody of Swinging the Alphabet is lame essentially cobbling the tune getting through A E hitting the obvious profanity a F and then having no idea where to go The trip through the intestines to the expected landing doesn t work the first time let alone the following ones Across the board the entire movie is what you would expect from someone trying to out South Park Stone and Parker without the ability to determine what is and isn t funny This might be amusing if you re high Otherwise it s not
0	This movie sucked The acting sucked the script sucked and the movie overall sucked There were two threads in the movie that were not developed and the viewer had to do a bit of work to figure out what was happening I m not saying that it needs to be spelled out but you suddenly find things happening and being said as if you have the slightest clue as to what they are Examples The heroine s negative comments about the hero The audience is never shown how she even knows anything about the guy and how he is tied into her fiance s death The viewer has minimal exposure to the guy s death as well Also all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns and that is all you see before cutting back to the other scenes No explanation what so ever about the guns and the folks with them We gave it a because we didn t feel like we wanted our time back It was fun to bad mouth the movie while watching it so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment
0	The ending of this movie made absolutely NO SENSE What a waste of perfectly good hours If you can explain it to me PLEASE DO I don t usually consider myself unable to get a movie but this was a classic example for me so either I m slower than I think or this was a REALLY bad movie
1	Jack Frost is Really a Cool Movie I Mean Its Funny Its Violent and Very Enjoyable Most People Say that it Is B Rated But That Couldn t be Farther from the truth It has Great Special Effects and Good Acting The Only Weird thing is of Course The Killer Snowman I Think this Movie was Actually one of The Best Films of the Late Nineties Most Films these Days lack the Criteria of A Clive Barker Master Piece That is Be Original and Give the Viewer What they Do not Expect Jack Frost is Very Cool out of Grade A Ed Also Recommends The Movie Uncle Sam to Fans of Jack Frost
1	I thought it was one of the best sequels I have seen in a while Sometimes I felt as though I would just want someone to die Stanley s killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant It was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died My only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird Judd Nelson is cute at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as Stanley Caldwell Brilliant movie
1	Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here Cage and Boyle are fine but what gives this neo noir its juice is Hopper s creepy violent character and JT Walsh s sneakiness A drifter gets mistaken for a hit man and tries to make a little dough out of it but gets in over his head I found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie when Cage walks into a trailer in Wyoming to get drilling work with the help of his buddy and the opening scene in Brokeback Mountain when the character does the same thing But that s another story Dennis Hopper is at his best here cocky one step ahead villainous seething and explosively violent JT Walsh RIP is also great as the man with a dark past trying to live legitimately well almost There are only real characters of note here with the exception of the hard working deputy in the town of Red Rock Wyoming The first twist hits early on and from there it s a nice neo noir adventure in some sleepy little town Satisfying pts
1	Excellent comedy starred by Dudley Moore supported by Liza Minnelli and good speaking John Gielgud Moore is Arthur a man belonging to a multimillionaire family who was near to get million dollars provided that he marries to a lady Susan from another multimillionaire family In principle Arthur accepted the conditions but he finally refused when he met nice and poor Linda Marolla Liza Minneli Arthur was just a parasite because he did not work he only enjoyed himself drinking hard and having fun with prostitutes After several serious thoughts in his life and for the first time Arthur decided not to marry Susan only few minutes before their wedding The end was happy for Linda and Arthur although the latter knew that his life will change in the coming future This comedy is a good lesson for life for anyone Rich people are not usually happy with their ways of life
1	This story is told and retold and continues to be retold in every possibly way imagine The immortal Charles Dicken s story has been recreated in every possible way imagine I admit I have not seen the classic Alistair Sim version and I m sure someday I will but I would be blown away if it touched even close to this amazing eighties version I believe that if Dickens himself had created his story for film this would be it The story is well known I won t go into much detail because everyone has seen it in one form or another A rich stingy mean old man is visited by the Ghost of his former partner and warned about his mean ways In order to straighten him out he is visited by three spirits each which show him a different perspective of his life and the people he is involved with past present and future Finally in seeing all this before him he realizes the error of his ways in a big way and attempts retribution for all the wrong he has done George C Scott is absolutely undeniably perfect for this role He takes hold of the Ebeneezer Scrooge role and makes it his own and creates an incredible character He is not just a mean old man but someone who has been effected by certain situations in his life that has made him bitter and angry at the world There is compassion within him but he holds it below everything else and is very self involved Scott delivers the role of perfection when it comes to Scrooge Not only does the leading role make this film but everything else fits into place This is a grand epic of Victorian England Dickens England is recreated before our very eyes the sights and the sounds and you can almost feel the breeze in your face and the smells of the market Director Clive Donner brilliantly recreates this scene and leaves nothing to the imagination I could watch this film on mute and be dazzled by the scenery It s not spectacular scenery per se but it s real The film takes us from the high class traders market to the very dismal pits of poverty and everything in between The rest of the cast fits into their roles and brings their literary counterparts to life Bob Cratchitt played by David Warner and his entire family including and especially the young Tiny Tim played by Anthony Walters were wonderful The Ghosts each had their own distinct personality and added to the dark mood of this story A Christmas Carol is not a light story Dickens wrote this story for a dark period in England s life and it s one of the few Christmas tales that is really dark almost scary and it has to be scary in order to scare a man who has been a miser for so many years into turning around The dark feel to the story is captured in this film and is downright frightening and yet the end lifts your spirits and captures Christmas miracles The score to this film is also something to be mentioned as it is epic and grand and beautiful to listen to whether it s the actual score or the Christmas music everything fits together Apparently Christmas movies are my favorite because I insist everyone see this Christmas Carol above all others
1	This movie is so cheap it s endearing With Ron Liebmann Major Vaughn providing the most entertaining on screen diatribes in film history I own copies of this movie on video on one Ralph Macchio is caught actually cracking up in the background at Major Vaugn while he is ranting at Hash Obviously they forgot to edit this mistake out of the film but it goes to show just how funny the movie is when the actors themselves can t keep a straight face
1	I have never observed four hours pass quite so quickly as when I saw this film This film restores the power and art to Hamlet that it was always meant to have Even those oh so famous speeches are done in new and inventive ways And the cast is incredible Brannagh the brightest star It is his charisma power and command of the role that defines the movie Making it a full and complete version fills so many holes and allows for new appreciation of the tragedy despite the length Where one would expect the dark gloomy cliched castle we are treated to a sumptuous feast for the eyes The only gloom comes from Hamlet himself as it should Well worth your time all four hours of it
0	The Shirley Jackson novel The Haunting of Hill House is an atmospheric tale of terror which conveys supernatural phenomena in an old mansion The atmosphere is well set out and the chills are staged well A haunting masterpiece The chiller The Haunting stays closely to the book but also adds its own details to the plot Fortunately these are very few and so the terror of the book and the chills are executed even better on the screen The black and white photography only adds to the creepiness of the movie Excellent And then Jan de Bont made this In the remake of The Haunting hit the cinemas if you could call this a remake Why they had to make a remake of the movie is a mystery in itself but for the moment lets look at the film itself It starts off averagely as most horror movies do The set used for Hill House is beautiful and oddly mysterious and for a few minutes it seems as if the film is actually going to be quite a fair re telling And then the first scare comes a loose harpsichord wire slashes a woman s face Dr Marrow s assistant This is hilarious and truth be told it nearly had me in tears From then on the film just spirals downwards The acting seems to become somewhat wooden as the film goes on with Owen Wilson s character being particularly irritating so it s such a relief when he s decapitated by the flue The special effects practically make this movie which is a shame because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated Examples of these are many so I won t bother listing them So all in all I along with hundreds of others strongly recommend that you watch the original chiller or as an alternative buy the novel by Shirley Jackson But please stay away from this And if you do decide to watch this watch it on the TV as a lot of the channels love to screen this film and not the original or rent it cheap but please don t buy it whatever you do Don t waste your money Final rating
1	ZP is deeply related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movement The college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that gives birth to that movement The explosion that Daria imagines represents the fall of all social structures and therefore the development of all that huge transformation that society is suffering through and finally Mark s death anticipates the end that A sees for the movement itself The film will be more easily understood if we go back to that time in life During the and young people were the driving force for the profound explorations for change One of the more significant changes intended was to bring sexuality out of the closet and i think the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would perform in the hipotetic situation where there would be nobody to hide from I watched the scene where the couples would throw sand to each other and appreciated the magnificent way in which A depicted the impossibility to continue hiding this basic human instinct Repression was the way to control social outbursts at that time and that is the method police applies to stop the students This society suffers from hipocresy and that comes clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls The dialogue between the policeman with the college professor who s detained for no reason shows part of society interested for this youth feeling and part completely uninterested Presenting flying as the more accurate symbol for freedom the stealing of the plane represents Mark s inner wish for it but his going back or coming back or returning segun shows the difficulties to come free from these bonds and as i ve said A depicts the death of the dream by these difficulties winning the game In my point of view a film to remember
1	Several years ago the Navy kept a studied distance away from the making of Men of Honor a film based on the experiences of the service s first black master chief diver s struggle to overcome virulent racism Ever eager to support films showing our Navy s best side the U S S Nimitz and two helicopter assault carriers with supporting shore installations were provided to complement this engrossing tale of a young sailor s battle with uncontrollable rage Some of the movie was shot aboard the U S S Belleau Wood Antwone Fisher wrote the script for Denzel Washington s director s debut in which he stars as a Navy psychiatrist treating Fisher played effectively and deeply by Derek Luke Fisher is an obviously bright enlisted man assigned to the U S S Belleau Wood LHA a front line helicopter assault platform Fisher can t seem to avoid launching his own assaults at minimal provocation from his fellow enlisted men Sent to the M D as part of a possible pre separation proceeding Fisher slowly opens up to the black psychiatrist revealing an awful childhood of great neglect and shuddering brutality The story develops as Fisher cautiously but increasingly trusts his doctor and gets the courage to pursue a love interest an enlisted sailor named Cheryl played by a stunningly beautiful Joy Bryant Fisher reluctantly engages with the doctor by asking long simmering questions but soon realizes he must seek the answers however painful in order to grow and move away from conflict seeking destructive behavior While all the main characters are black this story transcends race while unflinchingly showing the evil of exuberant religiosity and concomitant hypocrisy in foster family settings Viola Davis a versatile actress seen in a number of recent films is a picture of sullen immorality but is nothing compared to foster mom Mrs Tate Novella Nelson who in short but searing scenes would earn if it existed the Oscar for gut churning brutality Films about patient therapist interaction follow a certain predictability all that transference and counter transference stuff but the earnestness of Fisher and his doctor mentor is realistically gripping It s a good story well told Period While set in the Navy Antwone Fisher is not in any real sense a service story as was Men of Honor an excellent movie that dealt with crushing racism directed against a real person Nor is it truly a film about blacks It s about surviving terrible childhood experiences and as Fisher says being able to proclaim in adulthood that the victim is still standing tall The persecutors shrink in size and significance as a brave and strong young man claims his right to a decent life with the aid of a caring doctor My only quibble is that Washington is a lieutenant commander but is addressed as commander With all the Navy support people listed in the end credits someone should have told Director Washington that his character like all naval officers below the rank of commander is addressed as Mister Not a big criticism is it I don t know why this film is playing in so few theaters It deserves wide distribution Derek Luke may well get an Oscar nomination
0	Vulpine Massacre should have been this movies actual title And the tag line should have read Guaranteed to make your kids CRY This is a nature drama telling the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote region Starting with the meeting and pairing of two young foxes and the eventual birth of a large family and the trials of raising them The only speaking is done in narrative by a tree that stands over the den giving insight into the animals loves and lives Lovely scenery and gorgeous filming of the animals Sounds good huh Well from there things go straight to hell and then start drilling towards the core Spoilers Below Or they it may be a Warning Almost first off we learn one of the foxes is born blind But seems to get along well enough and there s a beautifully cheerful musical score to accompany him And then he dies Next we have one of the siblings adventures And then he dies One of the sisters gets her screen time and then she dies And so it goes like some horrific slasher movie as one fox after another is killed off by nature in traps just up and vanish and even by a bunch of snowmobiles By the end of the movie almost all the foxes have been massacred Though mercifully no deaths are shown on screen Least not in the version we saw Unlike say Tarka the Otter the deaths in this movie are almost all pointless and border on the sadistic in the way hopes are built up and then snuffed out One or two losses would have been acceptable It is a nature film after all But not nearly the whole family Do not go to see this film deceived by the cheery box into thinking its safe for the kids Watch it with some foreknowledge that things are not going to go well at all and that you or your kids may be left feeling very badly depending on how sensitive you or they are You may enjoy it Or you may not
0	Despite unfortunately thinking itself to be a intelligent b important and c interesting fortunately this movie is over mercifully quickly The script makes little sense the whole idea of the sado masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely trite and John Lydon shows us all in the space of one movie why he should never have let himself out of music His performance is one note and irritating The only positive thing to be said is that Harvey Keitel manages to deliver a good turn His later Bad Lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act but mercifully his performance here is restrained
1	I haven t laughed this hard at a movie in a long time I got to go to an advance screening and was thrilled because I had been dying to see it I had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie The audience all shared my laughter and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie Kudos to Steve Carrell who I had already been a fan of He proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy He has a style that I haven t seen before And Catherine Keener is excellent as always Thank God there wasn t a cameo from Will Ferrell love him but saw him too much this summer There were parts of comedic genius in this movie Partly thanks to Carrell and partly thanks to the writing also Carrell The waxing scene and the speed dater with the obvious problem were absolutely hysterical I will definitely go see Year Old Virgin when it s released My advice go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it
1	This movie was the best movie I have ever seen Being LDS I highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of Joseph Smith Although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone I saw this movie with my family and I can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart This movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with After I saw this movie there was not a single dry eye in the entire room Everyone was touched by what they saw and I have not been the same since I have seen it I highly recommend this movie for everyone
0	A pale shadow of a great musical this movie suffers from the fact that the director Richard Attenborough completely misses the point of the musical needlessly opens it up and muddies the thrust of the play The show is about a group of dancers auditioning for a job in a B way musical and examines their drive desire to work in this demanding and not always rewarding line of work Attenborough gives us a fresh faced cast of hopefuls assuming that they are trying to get their big break in show business rather than presenting the grittier mix of characters created on stage as a group of working gypsies living show to show along with a couple of newcomers The film has one advantage over the play and that is the opening scene showing the size of the original audition and the true scale of shrinkage down to the on the line depending on how you count Cassie who is stupidly kept out of the line in the movie Anyone who can catch a local civic light opera production of the play will have a much richer experience than seeing this poorly conceived film
0	The final film for Ernst Lubitsch completed by Otto Preminger after Lubitsch s untimely death during production is a juggling act of sophistication and silliness romance and music fantasy and costume dramatics In a th century castle in Southeastern Europe a Countess falls for her sworn enemy the leader of the Hungarian revolt she s aided by her ancestor whose painted image magically comes to life Betty Grable in a long blonde wig adorned with flowers has never been more beautiful and her songs are very pleasant Unfortunately this script by Samson Raphaelson taken from an operetta by Rudolf Schanzer and E Welisch is awash with different ideas that fail to mesh or entertain The results are good looking but unabsorbing from
1	I grew up in Houston and was nine when this movie came out As a result I don t remember anything about the movie But I do remember the sensation it caused from Gilley s and the mechanical bull to Johnny Lee s hit song Lookin for Love which still brings back memories of childhood whenever I hear it However a few years ago I saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all I can say is I was blown away Few movies have hit me harder This movie is as raw and real as you can get From Uncle Bob s ranch house the chemical plant in Texas City Gilley s dance hall and Bud and Sissy And maybe for that reason it doesn t have a wider appeal But no matter how you feel about country music I for one can t stand it despite my Houston roots Urban Cowboy is a unique slice of American pie For that reason I love it
0	I had the privilege of attending a special screening of The Absence of Light at a horror convention in Ohio First off you know you re in trouble when the director introduces a film saying Now keep in mind we didn t have much money Not that no budget films are bad but when a filmmaker uses this as an excuse the results are always poor And there is no better example than this unwatchable sleep fest Actually Absence of Light marks a first in the world of underground cinema It s the only time I ve seen a dream cast of talented genre vets actually bore me Charismatic actors like David Hess Tony Todd and Reggie Banister randomly enter and exit the movie and prove to be every bit as uninteresting as the amateurish no names Who are their characters What are they talking about Who cares It s all so dull you ll cease to care about anything or anyone After thirty minutes of this endurance test I gave up and walked out of the theater Not surprisingly so did most of the cast members in attendance Any curious genre fans would do well to stay away from this With a little luck this movie won t ever see the light of day
0	Having heard so many people raving about this film I thought I d give it a go Apart from being incredibly slow which I don t mind as long as the wait is worth it but it just isn t As many others have said there are so many inconsistencies and so much of this film just doesn t ring true The reaction of the men switches from shock horror on finding the body to complete indifference whilst they fish Surely if they were the type of men that would go on happily fishing then they would have just reported the body and said they had only discovered it after their fishing trip why on earth tie the body to a tree go fishing and then tell everyone you found the body days previously Its so hard to watch a film knowing that the behaviour of the main characters is so inconsistent As for the rest of the townsfolk well you d think at least one of them might show some curiosity about who actually killed the woman The body itself naked except for the knickers what scenario leads to that If she was raped then why still the knickers If she was raped with the clothes on then why remove them afterwards bar the knickers If she wasn t raped then why take all her clothes off bar the knickers leaving yourself with evidence to dispose of I truly cant think of any realistic scenario that would lead to that other than killing someone to steal their clothes so you can fill up your jumble sale stall Oh well its watchable but only just and only because despite the poor script the acting is strong
0	obviously has some talent attached Maria Bello is always great but this is just a dreary wast of time portraying every character as someone to be loathed and exploited so someone could make a movie out of an interesting story well i hope they got it out of their systems unfortunately for the audience there is no insight no sensitivity no context and really no humanity which would all be fine except it has no humor no horror no context and nothing constructive to say about the story it s trying to tell bad things happen you sit and watch it you don t care so what of the time the words based on a true story constitute an unintentional warning to the audience it means the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some events they heard about somewhere so they just throw them up on the screen and expect the true nature of the story to make the audience feel something without the filmmakers having to do any of the work i hope they had a great time making this movie it stinks on ice
1	Does anyone happen to know where this film was shot The aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful It appears to be England However Ivy s apartment building certainly looks like the Brill Building with its fascinating elevators Charles Mendl is listed as playing Sir Charles Gage Maybe I blinked but I never saw him Perhaps he was the husband s lawyer but again I don t recall that character being in the film other than being mentioned as having made a phone call Perhaps he was in the aviation scene Or the ballroom scene Did anyone spot him Herbert Marshall was years old when he shot this film
0	My title ought to be enough It baffles me that a culture so rich in literary excellence Dumas Flaubert Balzac Maupassant would churn out such tosh as the nouvelle vague cinematic movement Until the th century France had a great tradition of artistic lucidity and clever philosophy But the minute you hand them a movie camera they start acting like WOOOHOOO LOOK HOW WEIRD I CAN BE PLOT THEME PSHAW LET S FILM AN AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE GOING ROUND ROUND At least this is not as bad as Godard who has an unhealthy fascination with the backs of peoples heads Oh la la quel artiste No Truffaut maintains a degree of visual clarity But so does the security camera at a quickie mart The two are indistinguishable Haha just as an aside to all you dweeby film school nerds I bet the vein is popping out the side of your neck right now But don t leave without reading the last sentence of my review Anyway if you like French literature you will HATE this People who like this movie probably have never read any books other than the ramblings of Jack Kerouac or maybe Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy Or maybe they have read the lyrics to The Doors songs and they think that s profoundly moving Whatever floats yer boat I find it ironic that this film injects some weak allusions to Balzac one of the finest and most meaningful writers who ever lived Nice try Truffles But you re nowhere near the ballpark Avoid this film like an aids infected syringe If you re the type of person who likes to think then stick to Jean Cocteau ORPHEE Robert Bresson PICKPOCKET and the Japanese masters Kurosawa IKURU Kobayashi KAIDAN and Teshigahara SUNA NO ONNA If you re an idiot enjoy your Truffaut Godard and Andy Worhol And for pete s sake push that vein back in your neck You look like a cabbage
0	Basically this is about a couple who want to adopt a second child At the adoption agency they meet a mouse Stuart and they decide to adopt him If you think that this is stupid hold it because it s getting worse Stuart arrives to his new home where he is treated like a human child Spare me The rest is pretty much the usual clich about family problems jealousy from the elder brother and at the end all issues are resolved and they are all a happy family Boring and worn out as this is it is also shown in the most blunt and unsophisticated way I don t know if the director believed that he was being creative by introducing a mouse to the clich or he was just trying to fill in minutes but he only upgraded the clich from boring to abhorrent Then why I gave a and not a ZERO Because of the family cat who loves Stuart as much as the brother And because of some funny gigs where Stuart makes good use of his small size On the overall I believe that the film would work reasonably well if a Stuart was a PET and not a sibling b It had kept to the funny gigs like Stuart trying to outwit the cat and had left out boring clich s which don t even match with anything else
0	Can anybody do good CGI films besides Pixar I mean really animation looked antiquated by standards and even by Toy Story standards Or maybe they spent all their budget on Hugh Jackman Whatever their reasoning the story truly did suck Somehow Hugh Jackman is a rat a rat that is flushed down a toilet Yeah I know seems stereotypical But then the sewer mimicked the ways of London to an extent Throw in a promise of jewels and an evil frog and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainment I would like to say something entertained me Maybe the hookup in the movie Or maybe the happily ever after rat relationship But nothing did It had the talent but it blew up D
1	My first child was born the year this program came out and I played the record album for the boys every Christmas thereafter When the CD came out I bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives as they start families it invariably becomes their favorite Christmas album I recently found several DVD s made on DVD R from video tapes probably for sale on eBay The one I bought was an excellent copy and it was so great to see the show again after more than years There are some songs on the show that were not on the album and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show But both the CD and DVD will stay in our library as the best Christmas entertainment ever
1	I won t give anything away by describing the plot of this film other than to say that it begins with the return to Israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide It unfolds like a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out why her friend ended her life As she pursues her investigation and the information accumulates it leads inexorably to a devastating conclusion The film is expertly paced and the acting especially by Talia Sharon as Ya ara the blind woman is excellent Israeli film has definitely come of age and is now fully competitive with other foreign films though few have found a large audience in the U S

1	This police procedural is no worse than many others of its era and better than quite a few Obviously it is following in the steps of Dragnet and Naked City but emerges as an enjoyable programmer The best thing about it is the unadorned look it provides into a world now long gone the lower class New York of the late s early s Here it is in all its seedy glory from the old school tattoo parlors to the cheap hotels to the greasy spoons These old police films are like travelogues to a bygone era and very bittersweet to anybody who dislikes the sanitized soulless cityscape of today Also intriguing is the emphasis on the nuts and bolts scientific aspect of solving the crime in this case the murder of a tattooed woman found in an abandoned car Our main heroes Detectives Tobin and Corrigan do the footwork but without the tedious and painstaking efforts of the lab boys they d get nowhere Although the technology is not in the same league the cops here use the dogged persistence of a C S I investigator to track down their man The way some reviewers have written about this movie you think it would have been directed by Ed Wood and acted by extras from his movies What bosh I enjoyed John Miles as the gangly ex Marine turned cop Tobin he had a happy go lucky easy going approach to the role that s a welcome change from the usual stone faced histrionics of most movie cops of the period Patricia Barry is cute and delightful as his perky girlfriend who helps solve the crime Walter Kinsella is stuffy and droll as the older detective Corrigan I rather liked the chemistry of these two and it made for something a bit different than the sort of robotic Dragnet approach The mystery itself is not too deep and the final chase and shoot out certainly won t rank amongst the classics of crime cinema but during it s brief running time The Tattooed Stranger more than held my interest
1	Barbra Streisand s first television special was simply fantastic From her skit as a child to her medley of songs in a high fashion department store everything was top notch It was easy to understand how this special received awards Not muddled down by guest appearances the focus remained on Barbra thoughout the entire production
1	Will Smith delivers yet again in a film about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and his crusade to right his wrongs in a way that will touch even the most hardened of hearts Writer Grant Nieporte and Italian Director Gabriele Muccino come together and created a masterpiece that I highly recommend to purchase and keep in your movie collection as you will never grow tired of watching feeling this film I have the Highest Respects for Will Smith as he is not only a brilliant Actor but one can tell he has a genuine love for people and life which no doubt made him perfect for the character IRS Agent Ben Thomas he played in this film You will find yourself feeling his pain and anger the frustrations over his love for Emily played by Rosario Dawson who by the way was Fantastic as usual I found myself falling in love with the fact their characters were falling in love Woody Harrelson also stars in this Top Notch film I find it very difficult to write this review without giving away key plot points All I can say is Watch it and when you do make sure you have nothing to interrupt you take the phone off the hook sit back and get ready to start trying to unravel the mysterious life and past of IRS Agent Ben Thomas I thank you Will Smith for another Great Film
1	This film has been on my wish list for ten years and I only recently found it on DVD when my partner s grandson was given it He watched it at and was thrilled to learn that it was about my generation born in and evacuated in and he wanted to know more about it and me Luckily I borrowed it from him and watched it on my own and I cried all through it Not only did it capture the emotions the class distinction the hardship and the warmth of human relationships of those years as well as the cruelties spoken and unspoken but it was accurate I am also a bit of an anorak when it comes to ARP uniforms ambulances LCC in the right colour white and all the impedimenta of the management of bomb sites and the work of the Heavy Rescue Brigades I couldn t fault any of this from my memories and the sandbagged Anderson shelter and the WVS canteens brought it all back The difference between the relatively unspoiled life in the village and war torn London was also sharply presented I re lived and my own evacuation from London with this production I know Jack Gold s work of course and one would expect no more from him than this meticulous detail but it went far beyond the accurate representation of the facts and touched deep chords about human responses and the only half uttered value judgements of those years It was certainly one of the great high spots in John Thaw s acting career and of Gold s direction and deserves to be better known It is a magnificent film and I have already ordered a couple of copies to send to friends
1	This show was great it wasn t just for kids which I thought at first it is for the whole family The first season was mostly about the father looking after is two daughters and son he sadly passed away in season I Could believe it when I heard it I am clad they carried on with the show as that what would really happen in really life and I need to mention The Goodbye Episode it was so well made it must of be so hard for them to film this you could tell they were real tears in theirs eyes I am year old male and this episode did make me cry me as I know how they felt as my father died when I was years too just like Roy Season and Season had great comedy in there also season had some of my Favorites such Freaky Friday Secrets I Still think the show was Strong enough to go on I was disappointed that it ended it was one the best no it was the best Family comedy show ever since Home Improvement and it could have been the next Friends it should never have ended but still love watching the repeats everyday
1	Why a stupid boring crappy overrated film series like Star Wars gets all the hype and a truly amazing film like this one goes completely un noticed is beyond me This movie will really open your eyes to the dark disturbing sad and scary world we live in Unlike the boring Elephant this movie isn t one of those just a typical day until someome pulls the trigger movies this movie focuses more on what happens AFTER the event Deana played by the very hot and very talented Erika Christensen is a happy and healthy straight A student with great friends and a great life until she is injured on the day of the shooting by being shot in the head Luckily she is not killed but is severely injured and has to be in the hospital for a while causing her to be in a lot of emotional pain in addition to the physical Meanwhile Alicia played by the also very gorgeous and talented Busy Phillips is a nasty cold hearted rebellious anti social goth girl who doesn t have a single positive trait on her and she is unharmed when the shooting happens because it turns out she was FRIENDS with the shooter and knew he was going to do what he did which causes her to be brought into the police station and be asked some questions When she refuses to tell the cops if she knew the shooting was going to happen they constantly come by her house to try to convince her to say something and she still doesn t so the principal of the school makes her attend a funeral of one of the dead students and after she walks out on that the principal decides enough is enough and forces her to go visit Deana in the hospital Of course she refuses this too but the principal says that if Alicia doesn t do this the cops are going to continue to try to get her to say something and so she actually goes to see her The lonely traumatized and both physically and emotionally wounded Deana is more than happy to have someone visit her but of course Alicia is anything BUT happy to be seeing her Deana attempts to give her a friendly welcome but of course Alicia responds with nothing but harsh and hurtful comments and a harsh statement on how she is only here because she is being forced and has no intention of being friendly with her at all But sooner or later that intention will change and that s all I ll say This is truly one of the most moving movies ever as well as one of the most dark and disturbing Actually I think I would tie this with American History X as equally disturbing and moving at the same time WARNING Watch this movie at your own risk It contains VERY graphic scenes and images EXCELLENT and criminally under appreciated movie I feel so ashamed that I m pretty much the only one that knows about it
0	Using footage pillaged from Planet of Dinosaurs this shot on video except for the stolen footage concerns a bunch of people shot into space who land on a dinosaur planet that is don t wait for it is really earth Its a five minute sketch stretched to minutes Slightly better than Chickboxer another in the Bad Movie Police series having a nostalgic home movie feel coupled with good stolen effects this movie is still an impossible slog to get through I m left to ponder the question are we becoming so uncreative that we re now pillaging old movies not only for plot but also for mismatched footage Clearly low budget producers are getting so desperate they really will give us anything to take our money
1	A year or so ago I was watching the TV news when a story was broadcast about a zombie movie being filmed in my area Since then I have paid particular attention to this movie called Fido as it finished production and began playing at festivals Two weeks ago Fido began playing in my local theater And just yesterday I read a newspaper article which stated Fido is not attracting audiences in it s limited release with the exception of our local theater In fact here it is outdrawing all other shows at The Paramount Theater including Of course this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen or spot themselves roaming around in zombie make up And for any other locals who haven t seen Fido yet but are considering it I can say there are many images on screen from the school to city park to the forbidden zone that you will recognize In fact they make the Okanagan Valley look beautiful That s right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie However Fido itself is a very good movie Yes despite its flaws it is better then most of the other movies playing in my local market Fido is best described as an episode of Lassie in which the collie has been replaced by a member of the undead This is a clever premise And the movie even goes further by taking advantage of the s emphasize on conformity and playing up the cold war paranoia which led to McCarthyism Furthermore it builds on the notion that zombies can be tamed or trained which George Romero first introduced in Day Of The Dead K Sun Ray plays a small town boy who s mother Carrie Ann Moss longs for a zombie servant so she can be like all the other house wives on her block However his dad Dylan Baker is against the idea as he once had to kill his own zombie father Eventually the family does acquire a zombie named Fido played by Billy Connolly and adjusts to life with the undead Billy Connolly was inspired casting He is able to convey Fido s confusion longing hatred and loyalty through only his eyes lumbering body and grunts Connolly shows that he can play understated characters better than his outrageously comedic ones This is his best role since Mrs Brown Fido follows in the footsteps of other recent zomcoms such as Shawn Of The Dead and Zombie Honeymoon Being someone who appreciates Bruce Campbell and Misty Mundae movies more than Eli Roth and Jigsaw ones I prefer humor over gore in my horror However I understand the criticism of those horror fans who feel there is not enough undead carnage in Fido Yet I am sure patient viewers will be rewarded by the films gentle humor The movie does break down in it s third act It s as if the writers were so wrapped up in the cute premise of domesticated zombies in the s they forgot about the story arc However given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighborhood on screen I rate Fido out of
0	That this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at Sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these days First of all there is such a thing as the art of cinematography Just picking up a mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real movie I guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director didn t pick up someone s camcorder Second indie films are supposed to be about real people There s nothing real in this film None of the characters come across as being even remotely human What they come across as being is figments of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how cool and edgy he is Sorry but this is not good writing or good directing What is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to Sundance Hard to believe this was one of the best films submitted In any case it made me loose what was left of my respect for the Sundance brand
0	Although the director tried the filming was made in Tynisia and Morocco this attempt to transport the New Testament in the screen failed The script has serious inaccuracies and fantasies while the duration is very long But the most tragic is the protagonist Chris Sarandon who doesn t seem to understand the demands of his role
0	While the premise behind The House Where Evil Dwells may be intriguing the execution is downright pathetic I m not even sure where to begin as I ve got so many problems with this movie I suppose I ll just number a few of them The Acting When you see that Edward Albert Doug McClure and Susan George and her teeth are the stars of your movie you know you re in trouble Not that it matters much to me but these are hardly A List names Susan George may have been in a couple of movies I enjoy but I ve never considered her the greatest actress I ve ever seen And in this movie her acting is embarrassing As for the other two the less said the better The Ghosts The ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride at Disney World And they are about as frightening And why did they have to be so obvious Subtlety is not a characteristic of The House Where Evil Dwells The Plot How predictable can one movie be The outcome of this movie is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters If you couldn t see where this movie was headed after about minutes you need to see more movies The Convenient Priest What are the chances that the haunted house you buy just happens to be across the street from a group of Japanese monks Not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes over knocks on the door and asks if you need help removing evil spirits Absurd is a word that comes to mind Everything Else It s very difficult for me to think of any positives to write about I suppose I ll give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the house s architecture That s a sure sign of a winner noting the architecture as a highlight of any film doesn t say much about the actual movie I ll stop You should be able to get the idea from what I ve already mentioned And I haven t even mentioned the annoying little girl or the Invasion of the Crabs or a multitude of other problems Be warned this thing is horrible
1	An ultra nervous old man Mr Goodrich terrorized by the news that a gang is stalking the city and prominent citizens are disappearing really panics when someone throws a rock through his window with a message tied to it saying You will be next He calls the detective agency wondering where are the guys he asked for earlier Of course it s the Stooges who couldn t respond because had come into the office robbed them and tied them up Some detectives The moment poor Mr Goodrich hangs up the phone and says I feel safer already a monster type goon named Nico appears out of a secret panel in the room and chokes him unconscious We next find out that his trusted employees are anything but that Now these crooks have to deal with the detectives that are coming by the house for Mr Goodrich Some of the gags like Moe and Larry s wrinkles are getting a bit old but some of them will provoke laughs if I see them times I always laugh at Shemp trying to be a flirt as he does here with Mr Goodrich s niece in a classic routine with a long accordion like camera lens The act he puts on when he s poisoned is always funny too Shemp was so good that I didn t mind he was taking the great Curly s place Larry Moe Curly Shemp were always great in the chase scenes in which monsters or crooks or both are chasing them around a house That s the last six minutes in here At times such as this film
0	Despite the mysteriously positive reviews and high rating this is an awful movie Awful enough that l feel obligated to warn you how bad it is The movie is set in the final period of the Raj during the time of India s fight for independence What follows in the ridiculous plot just fills me with disbelief What the characters do and how they behave just does not persuade me that the characters exist in that era For instance would the young married Hindu housemaid from the local village have an affair with her married Englishman Master knowing full well that discovery of the affair would likely mean utter social ostracization and shame if not mortal punishment Unlikely but still maybe However would the same young Hindu housemaid in the conservative society of India of that era carry on like a half naked Britney Spears in heat partake in hot outdoor sex during daylight in open view where they might be discovered at any moment That is not only bloody unlikely that is a retarded plot line Such idiocies combined with the poor acting drove me to leave the cinema an hour into the movie so i did not watch the second half of the movie One could only hope the ending is of more intelligence than what i saw in the first half
1	This movie works because it feels so genuine The story is simple and realistic perfectly capturing the joys and anxieties of adolescent love and sexuality that most all of us experienced during our teen years The actors are as natural as figures in a documentary but are as convincing and as charismatic as seasoned performers The dialogue is fresh and honest and thankfully not filled to the brim with cutesy pop culture references Also the cinematography is at once gritty and beautiful bringing the Lower East Side setting to life in a very tangible way On an artistic level I love this movie because it reminds me of great Italian neo realism films like The Bicycle Thief and La Strada Movies rarely feel as real as this does or as Bicycle Thief did And the only other movie I ve seen that treats teen sexuality with the same level of seriousness is Elia Kazan s Splendor in the Grass Writer director Peter Sollett deserves tremendous praise This film is quite an achievement On a personal level I am always glad to see a movie that treats members of ethnic America with love and respect As an Italian American I hate the way my own people come off in the cinema as racist womanizing criminal geniuses in irritatingly popular epics and my aggravation on this count makes me acutely sensitive to other groups and their awful silver screen representations Hispanics and Asians in particular seem cursed to playing villains in Westerns and action movies Good thing Gong Li didn t try to become famous in America Of course thanks largely to the rise of indie pictures and the influence of Miramax we are seeing a few more pictures about ethnic characters here and there but Raising Victor Vargas is easily one of the best While I do really like My Big Fat Greek Wedding it is a refreshing change that Raising Victor Vargas is played straight with less exaggerated and broadly drawn characters while still being very funny in its own right Finally Latino characters worthy of note I have a feeling that this is a film that will be remembered Of course now that he has made this wonderful picture about a family from the Dominican Republic I hope Peter Sollett gets around to making a movie about Italians soon Marc DiPaolo
1	Anna Charlotte Burke develops a strange fever that causes her to pass out and drift off into a world of her own creation A bleak world she drew with a sad little boy as the inhabitant of an old dumpy house in the middle of a lonely field Lacking in detail much like any child drawing the house and it s inhabitant Marc who can t walk because Anna didn t draw him any legs are inhabitants of this purgatory limbo world Anna begins visiting the boy and the house more frequently trying to figure what s what and in the process tries to help save the boy but her fever is making it harder for her to wake up each time and may not only kill her but trap her and Marc there forever Wow Is a good word to sum up Bernard Rose s brilliantly haunting and poetic Paperhouse A film that is so simple that it s damn near impossible to explain and impossible to forget While you may find this puppy in your horror section it s anything but It s more of a serious fantasy expertly directed and exceptionally well acted by it s cast in particular Charlotte Burke and Elliot Speirs Marc And yet it s not a children s movie either but meant to make us remember those carefree days of old that are now just dark memories Rose creates a rich tapestry of moody ambiance that creates a thrilling backdrop for the brilliant story and great actors to play with Paperhouse stays away from trying to explain it s more dreamy qualities and leaves most things to the viewers imagination There s much symbolism and ambiguity here to sink your teeth into Paperhouse enjoys playing games with the viewers mind engrossing you with it s very own sense of reasoning As the story unfolded I was again and again impressed at just how powerful the film managed to be up to the finale which left me with a smile on my face and a tear in my eye Bernard Rose s visuals are brilliant here He s able to create an unnervingly bleak atmosphere that appears simple on the surface but as a whole is much greater than the sum of it s parts The acting is of young Charlotte Burke in this her feature debut is a truly impressing as well Unfortunately she s not graced the screen since A much deserved Burnout Central award only seems proper for that performance Toward the end the movie lags a bit here and there but I was easily able to overlook it I wished they had took a darker turn creating a far more powerful finale that would have proved to be all the more unnerving and truly riveting in retrospect The movie as is is still one for the books and deserves to be seen by any serious film lover It s a poetic ride told through the innocent eyes of a child a powerful film in which much is left to be pondered and far more to be praised
0	I have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film I even got the rental company to give me my money back because I argued that they perpetrated false advertising It s not enough that the movie itself is a p o s but the cover art is what sold me I ve done better make up effects on my children at Halloween than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art Can you say raccoon eyes I m not going to waste more of my time by going into the full details but come on the movie s main character is an L A cop who was born and raised in Alabama but has a German accent It s beyond insulting
1	Some may feel that the rating i have just given is a bit generous but for what this film is i think the directors have done a good job with that they had available to them this is also a film a film of an acquired taste my immediate thought was the direct connection to the classic cult film The Thing i e the parasitical aliens from outta space infesting human host to then reek havoc wherever possible You can see how this film pays homage to such a film and others of the horror gore genre however cleverly maintains its own originality well these things fight each other for one and then continue to eat then fallen rival Only killing and picking a human when it needs a new host To then pick another fight with another infected host And this film even throws in a love story but i wont say no more otherwise it gives too much away GREAT But like i said of an acquired taste so don t be surprised if you don t like the film It is low budget and yes it is blood thirsty with the creatures aliens things morphing their limbs into crude looking weapons i e saws drills blades and even the odd gun to all but decimate there opponent I found myself cringing at what i was being shown but at the same time glued to the screen wondering what was going to happen next So if you like gore you like aliens you like fighting and even maybe a little bit of love thrown in somewhere then i must recommend this film as a must see I just wish i came across this earlier then i did
1	Tiempo de Valientes fits snugly into the buddy action movie genre but transcends its roots thanks to excellent casting tremendous rapport between its leads and outstanding photography Diego Peretti stars as Dr Silverstein a shrink assigned to ride shotgun with detective Diaz Luis Luque who s been assigned to investigate the murder of two minor hoods who seem to have been involved in am arms smuggling conspiracy Diaz has been suspended from duty but he s the best man for the job and must have professional psychiatric help in order to be reinstated Silverstein and Diaz soon find themselves enmeshed in a conspiracy involving Argentina s intelligence community and some uranium and the film separates them at a crucial point that allows Silverstein to develop some impressive sleuthing skills of his own Peretti and Luque are excellent together and remind me of screen team Terence Hill and Bud Spencer though Peretti isn t as classically handsome as Hill Remarkably even at almost two hours in length Tiempo de Valientes doesn t wear out its welcome and indeed writer director Damian Szifron sets up a potential sequel in the film s charming coda All in all a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy that neither panders to the lowest common denominator nor insults your intelligence

0	Awful This thriller should have buried What a piece of crap Terrible writing characters are less than believable Horrible Schlock Stick some B stars in a terribly written POS to try and give it a little credit but it fails miserably If I didn t have to write ten lines about this movie I would have given it a word word review it starts with sh and ends with it Horrible ending retarded Who writes this crap The ending of this film is so contrived weak it s as if they had no idea what to do with this story line or they just ran out of money Most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie It s a good thing that these actors are on the way out because this would be a career killer Good thing for them that hardly anyone will see it At least no one important like future investors It could have ended a thousand different ways but as it is I feel cheated out of my precious time Don t bother with this one you will feel like you wasted time you can never get back
1	This is the first out of that I ve given any movie What made this movie so good for me Constant action there isn t any slow parts great acting smart writing I also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene Finally I get to see an action movie that doesn t try to please all sectors of the public i e there s no forced romance I liked the first two Bourne movies but I loved this one Warning after watching this movie you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car
0	This is absolutely the worst movie I ve seen all year First I will say that the acting was very good and by all of the cast This was apparently meant to be very offbeat and in that regard it succeeded By the same token the story revolves around a self centered wannabe who is a clueless talentless chronic liar whose source of self confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers This was worse than watching a car wreck
1	First off if you re planning on watching this make sure to watch the UNCUT version although it is very interesting to go back and then watch the scenes that were tampered with due to censorship it makes a HUGE difference This film is about a young woman played by Barbara Stanwyck who since the age of has been forced into prostitution by her own father When her father suddenly passes away she is able to go out into the world on her own After reading about Nietzsche s philosophies on life she uses her sexuality to manipulate men into giving her what she wants and leaves them in ruins and desperate for her love Throughout the movie she becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative and the audience begins to wonder is she has any sense of morality left at all Overall Baby Face is a very shocking movie with blatant scenes of sexuality that most people would not expect to see in a black and white film While no sexual acts are explicitly shown on screen it is very obvious what is happening off camera I enjoyed watching this film very much and I believe most modern audiences will get at least some enjoyment out if it especially with the films shock value I did think while watching it that the pacing seemed a bit slow at parts but I think that about most movies the first time is see them Actually I think that almost all movies I ve seen made from the early s had some minor pacing problems or certain parts just didn t quite flow right This was probably just the craft of film making wasn t quite perfected yet it would take just a few more years Compare a film from and compare it with an early s film and I think you ll see what I mean Once again I m very glad I was able to watch the original cut it really does make a big difference Also any John Wayne fans will be surprised to see him in this movie before he was famous in an uncharacteristic role
0	This movie was God awful from conception to execution The US needs to set up a Star Wars site in this remote country This is their premise The way to gain access the US concludes is to win an obstacle course like cross country race where the winner can ask anything of the leader And who better to win this race known as the Game than a gymnast Of course A gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission And don t forget that his father was an operative Lucky for our hero there happen to be gymnastic equipment in fortunate spots like the stone pommel horse in the middle of a square for no reason amidst crazy town Perfect But above and beyond the horrible HORIBBLE premise is the awkward fumblings of the romantic scenes the obviously highly depressed ninjas whose only job seems to be holding a flag to point out the race path and the worst climax ever After winning the race our hero puts forth the wishes of the US government And lo and behold all the effort was worth it because the US gets its Star Wars site Huzzah THIS IS YOUR TRIUMPHANT ENDING Wow But still being such a bad movie it can be great fun to watch The cover alone depicting ninjas with machine guns was enough to get me to rent this film But if I were ever to meet Kurt Thomas the gymnast star in real life I would probably kick him in the face after a double somersault with twists in the layout position
0	Ridiculous horror film about a wealthy man John Carradine dying and leaving everything to his four children and his servants to be divided up equally One condition they must spend one week in his estate to get the money And if any of them die the others get more Guess what happens next I saw a brand new print of this film on cable The colors were bright and vivid and the house itself looks beautiful That s about all the good things I can say about it Let s list just some of the problems this film has the killer is screamingly obvious the servants are called Igor and Elga come on some of the sound recording was so bad I couldn t make out the dialogue no great loss I m sure the gore was sparse and very poorly done the other murders were simply boring stupid or impossible and this movie contains some truly abominable acting so bad you just stare at the screen in disbelief Even pro Jeff Morrow was terrible The only fairly good acting was from trouper Faith Domergue who deserved better than this and John Carradine who looks painfully old and frail here I do have to admit though the closing line in this movie is a gem Why this was renamed Legacy of Blood is beyond me there s another horror film with that name Whatever its name is it s a bad movie To be avoided at all costs
0	There s been a vogue for the past few years for often as not ironic zombie related films as well as other media incarnations of the flesh eating resurrected dead Fido is a film that s either an attempt to cash in on that simply a manifestation of it or both and it falls squarely into the category of ironic zombies The joke here is that we get to see the walking dead in the contrasting context of a broadly stereotyped squeaky clean alternate history we are in the wake of a great Zombie War and the creatures are now being domesticated as slaves version of a s suburb It s a moderately funny concept on its own and enough perhaps for a five minute comedy sketch but it can t hold up a feature film on its own The joke that rotting corpses for servants are incongruous with this idealized version of a small town is repeated over and over again and loses all effectiveness The soundtrack relentlessly plays sunny tunes while zombies cannibalize bystanders The word zombie is constantly inserted into an otherwise familiarly homey line for a cheap attempt at a laugh The very broadness and artificiality of the representation of the nineteen fifties here can t help but irritate me It is so stylized in it evidently Pleasantville inspired way that it is more apparent in waving markers of its s ness around than actually bearing any resemblance to anything that might have happened between and There is something obnoxiously sneering about it as if the film is bragging emptily and thoughtlessly about how more open down to Earth and superior the s are Because the characters are such broad representations of pop culture s types it s difficult to develop much emotional investment in them Each has a few character traits thrown at him or her Helen is obsessed with appearances and Bill loves golf and his haunted by having had to kill his father but they remain quite two dimensional Performances within the constraints of this bad writing are fine The best is Billy Connolly as Fido the zombie who in the tradition of Boris Karloff in Frankenstein actually imparts character and sympathy to a lumbering green monster who cannot speak There are little bits of unsubtle allegory thrown around to commodity fetishism racism classism war paranoia et cetera but none of it really works on a comprehensive level and the filmmakers don t really stick with anything Unfortunately this film doesn t really get past sticking with the flimsy joke of Look Zombies in Leave it to Beaver for a good hour and a half
1	Cliffhanger is what appears to be Slyvester Stallone s last action movie before he became such an underrated actor It s about a mountain climber that must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries that want them to find three suitcases carrying money over million dollars It has great action sequence s edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies
0	What about Dahmer s childhood The double hernia operation which is believed to have sparked off his obsession with the inner workings of the human body What about infinity land The game he invented as a child which involved stick men being annihilated when they came too close to one another suggesting that intimacy was the ultimate danger What about the relationship between his parents and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father His feelings of neglect when his brother was born What about his fascination with insects and animals How he would dissect roadkill and hang it up in the woods behind his home What about focusing more on his cannibalism And what about his parent s divorce These are all things that should have been included in the film Instead the film maker chose to give us a watered down snapshot from a night or two in his life and combine it with series of confusing and at times unnecessary flashbacks to events that weren t even particularly relevant to our understanding of Dahmer Why didn t the film maker show how Dahmer was interested in people as objects rather than people He could have made this point many times particularly in the scenes in which he drugs his victims whilst he has sex with them which actually took place in a health club not a night club Instead he just shows him ramming away at them from behind Whilst I appreciate there is only so much information you can cram into minutes or however long but why spend such a large part of the film examining his relationship with Luis Pinet known as Rodney in this film My only guess is that the director was trying to build up Pinet s character to try and make us fear for or empathise with him but this film is supposed to be about Jeffrey Dahmer so why couldn t he have spend those forty five minutes on something else If the scene and their relationship was important enough to warrant such time then fair enough but it wasn t The scene in which he kills Steven Hicks his first victim is a vital part of the Jeffrey Dahmer story because it was the first killing and because of the effect that killing had on the rest of his life Unfortunately the film doesn t explain that it was his first killing or that he didn t kill again for nine years We assume because his hair style is different and he is wearing glasses that this is a flashback but to when And why What about the shrine he made in his sitting room towards the end of his career one of the most important clues we have towards understanding Dahmer and his motivations Some people may find my need for accuracy in fact and detail a bit anal but having studied Jeffrey Dahmer in depth it is plain to see that this film has very little in common with the person he was and the crimes he committed Why bother to spend the time making a film loosely based on Jeffrey Dahmer rather than tackle the real issues behind his descent into madness and the carnage that ensued Finally a film with subject matter as repellent as this should carry an certificate not a We needed to see his perversion in more depth to understand just how detached he was from the rest of us That doesn t mean showing the drill actually entering Konerak Sinthasomphone s head for instance but at least an indication of the amount of people he killed and what his Modus Operandi was when actually killing Anyone watching this film who doesn t know the story of Dahmer might come away thinking he had only killed a few people He actually killed seventeen men Aside from the facts and lack of depth the film isn t all bad There is some nice cinematography and good performances from the two main characters I d like to see this done again by a film maker who has more knowledge more energy and a better reason for making the film in the first place
1	I saw this film for the very first time several years ago and was hooked up in an instant It is great and much better than J F K cause you always have to think Can it happen to me Can I become a murderer You cannot turn of the TV or your VCR without thinking about the plot and the end which you should nt miss under any circumstances
1	No one would argue that this war film was a masterpiece How could any war film be a masterpiece And yet this is an extremely effective telling of a true story that of Al Schmidt blinded on Guadalcanal as played by John Garfield who spent days wearing a blindfold to capture the nuances of a blind person s actions Robert Leckie in Helmet for My Pillow denigrates Schmidt s popularity in favor of his foxhole mate who was killed writing that the country must have needed live heroes Well I suppose the country did And they had one here There is a single combat scene in the movie bound to the studio lot lasting only ten minutes or so and occurring less than halfway through the film instead of being saved for the climax but it is the scariest and most realistic depiction of men under fire that I can remember having seen on screen including those in Saving Private Ryan Men yell with fear scream at each other and at the enemy and bleed and die without the aid of color stereophonic sound squibs or gore Simply from a technological point of view the film is outstanding It isn t just that we learn how complicated a mechanism a caliber water cooled Browning machine gun is or that it must be fired in bursts of only a few rounds or that it isn t waved around like a fire hose as in so many other war movies The technical precision adds to the scene s riveting quality The need to stick to short bursts is horrifying when dozens of shrieking enemies are pouring across a creek fifty feet away with the sole aim of exterminating you and your two isolated comrades confined to a small gun emplacement The performances are solid if not bravura including those of the ubiquitous s support John Ridgeley and a radiant youthful Eleanor Parker The framing love story is spare but it works and ultimately is quite moving A striking dream sequence is included It s not Bunuel but for a routine film it stands out as original and effective Albert Maltz may have overwritten the script or it may have been altered by someone else It could have used the kind of pruning that might have introduced some much needed ambiguity Still there are odd verbal punctuations that have a surprising impact on the viewer Why don t God strike me dead And In the eyes Lee Get em in the eyes Depths of anguish in a few corny words And a surprising amount of bitterness expressed by wounded veterans in a war film Notes that might seem false to a contemporary viewer but perhaps shouldn t the dated vernacular which it s difficult to believe many of today s kids could think was actually ever spoken private gab dope drip Gee you dumb coot dame a swell guy and feeling sorry for yourself Let us consider the historical context and be kind in our judgments At the time some of this goofy lingo was at the cutting edge Real weak points The wounded veterans get together and argue with each other about how much of a collective future they have and the argument is oversimply resolved with a conclusion along the lines of Just because you have a silver plate in your head doesn t mean people will think you re a bad person There are sometimes voice overs and silent prayers that are both unnecessary and downright unimaginative Please God let him return to me and that sort of thing Well the film makers were operating within the constraints of their times Maybe that s why the final fade is on a shot of Independence Hall and the inspiring strains of America the Beautiful swell in the back None of this can undo the film s virtues which are considerable particularly the impact of that horrifying combat scene It s not on television that often If you have a chance by all means catch it
1	Brilliant execution in displaying once and for all this time in the venue of politics of how good intentions do actually pave the road to hell Excellent
0	This ranks as one of the worst movies I ve seen in years Besides Cuba and Angie the acting is actually embarrassing Wasn t Archer once a decent actress What happened to her The action is decent but completely implausible The make up is so bad it s worth mentioning I mean who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film Someone should tell the make up artist and the DOP that you re not supposed to actually see it The ending is a massive disappointment along the lines of and then they realized it was all a dream Don t waste your time or your money You re better off just staring into space for hours
1	If you like cars you will love this film There are some superb actors in the film especially Vinnie Jones with his typical no nonsense attitude and hardcase appearance The others are not bad either There are only two slight flaws to this film Firstly the poor plot however people don t watch this film for the plot Secondly the glorification of grand theft auto car crime However if people really believe they can steal a Ferrari and get away with it then good look to them hope you have a good time in jail When i first read that Nicolas Cage was to act the main role i first thought sweeet but then i thought naaaa you suck but then finally after watching the film i realised yep he suck s Only joking he plays the role very well I ll end this unusual review by saying If the premature demise of a criminal has in some way enlightened the general cinema going audience as to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life and inspired them to change their ways then this death carries with it an inherent nobility And a supreme glory We should all be so fortunate You can say Poor Criminal I say Poor us p s Angelina Jolie Voight looks quite nice
1	Excellent view of a mature woman that is going to lose everything even the pruner has a mortgage The way she gets involved into this special business the innocence and the true love that exists between the people of a little town it s mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh light and funny comedy I couldn t stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore I love European films and with movies like this one my opinion grows stronger A movie that I also recommend with my eyes closed in this same genre is Waking Ned Devine Saving Grace a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself You will love it
0	And the Oscar for the most under rated classic horror actor goes to Dwight Frye Seriously his name should be stated with the same awe as Karloff Lugosi and Price and this movie proves it His character Herman was one of the reasons I can give to watch this movie Dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly disturbed misfit a lovable yet creepy demeanor that led you hoping for a larger role the entire movie The other reason is the comic relief of M Eburne Being in the medical profession myself I have to give kudos to the expert performance of a self pity prone hypochondriac Though other medical mistakes did give a brief chuckle especially when the good doctor samples his fellow physicians medication Well continue giving it to her Unfortunately these outstanding performances could not keep me awake through attempts of sitting through this unbearably slow movie The plot is predictable with only few minor twists The filming while pulling off a legitimate spooky atmosphere was more productive at making me yawn yes you can use too much shadow My recommendation watch this once to see Frye and Eburne but only when wide awake and with lots of caffeine
1	As I said in my comment about the first part These two movies are better than most Science Fiction Fans confess The scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we don t see the destruction of human civilization but the aftermath thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans protected by only one powerful spaceship But when Battlestar Pegasus appears the story heats up carrying the battle back to the Cylon Planets Okay it has a little bit of Mad Max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant Earth but it works for me It is thrilling Science Fiction entertainment featuring fine actors and decent special effects even though those tend to repeat themselves to say the least I would have loved a continuation with Starbuck and Apollo on board Instead we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well chosen So thumbs down for the productions of but thumbs up for the two movies from
0	A young boy sees his mother getting killed and his father hanging himself years later he gets a bunch of friends together to perform an exorcism on himself so he won t turn out like his father All the stock characters are in place the nice couple the funny guy the tough but sensitive hood the smart girl she wears glasses that s how we know the nerd and two no personality blondes It all involves some stupid wooden statue that comes to life don t ask and kills people I knew I was in trouble when after a great opening scene we jump to years later ALL bad horror movies do that The dialogue is atrocious the acting is bad except for Betsy Palmer why Betsy and the killings are stupid and or unimaginative My favorite scene is when two people are supposedly having sex and the statue knocks the guy off the bed to show he s fully dressed A real bad stupid incoherent horror film Avoid at all costs
0	At the name of Pinter every knee shall bow especially after his Nobel Literature Prize acceptance speech which did little more than regurgitate canned by the numbers sixth form anti Americanism But this is even worse not only is it a tour de force of talentlessness a superb example of how to get away with coasting on your decades old reputation but it also represents the butchery of a superb piece The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind Yes it was a theatrical confection and it is easy to see how it s central plot device would work better on the stage than the screen but it still worked terrifically well This is a Michael Caine vanity piece but let s face it Caine is no Olivier Not only can he not fill Larry s shoes he couldn t even fill his bathroom slippers The appropriately named Caine is after all a distinctly average actor whose only real recommendation like so many British actors is their longevity in the business He was a good Harry Palmer excellent in Get Carter but that s yer lot mate Give this a very wide berth and stick to the superb original This is more of a half pinter
0	As one of the few commentators not to have seen the st film I found this to be a very disappointing movie Yes it has a funny awkward type of humour if you can bear the highly morally dubious premise However it fails abysmally in the important areas There is thin and nonsensical plot line involving Gordon Sinclair s generous friend who may or may not be entwined in a conspiracy to supply dangerous electronics to Third World countries possibly in free computers or possibly not Vague long winded and inconclusive The lack of any substantial ending is so infuriating and what is present is pompous and wholly illogical The film feels half finished Suspension of disbelief is extremely difficult when witnessing a very attractive female teacher Maria Doyle Kennedy can be drawn to Gordon Sinclair s unimpressive character especially when he fends off her advances Laughable It worsens later in the film when he achieves his romantic ambitions then throws it all away for some ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguous value Not many films leave me feeling cheated but I felt my time was stolen
1	Homelessness or Houselessness as George Carlin stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school work or vote for the matter Most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism the war on Iraq pressuring kids to succeed technology the elections inflation or worrying if they ll be next to end up on the streets But what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home the entertainment sets a bathroom pictures on the wall a computer and everything you once treasure to see what it s like to be homeless That is Goddard Bolt s lesson Mel Brooks who directs who stars as Bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival Jeffery Tambor to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries if Bolt succeeds he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings The bet s on where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can t step off the sidewalk He s given the nickname Pepto by a vagrant after it s written on his forehead where Bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of Molly Lesley Ann Warren an ex dancer who got divorce before losing her home and her pals Sailor Howard Morris and Fumes Teddy Wilson who are already used to the streets They re survivors Bolt isn t He s not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it s fight or flight kill or be killed While the love connection between Molly and Bolt wasn t necessary to plot I found Life Stinks to be one of Mel Brooks observant films where prior to being a comedy it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as Blazing Saddles Young Frankenstein or Spaceballs for the matter to show what it s like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don t know what to do with their money Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like Monopoly money Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others
0	This is truly terrible painfully irritating stylised performers screech and mug gratingly incoherent dialogues which take place in scenes which seem to have no purpose no beginning middle or end cut together without any apparent narrative or even cognitive intention all in the service of some entirely uninteresting and almost undetectable story What makes it worse is the film s pretentions to style suddenly a remote head crane shot spirals downwards and without any apparent reason there are sudden whip pans or wobblyhand held sections all this style merely serves to magnify the almost unbelievably huge misconception of the project and the almost offensive vacuity of the material Definitely a candidate for the worst film ever made
1	I Last night I had the pleasure of seeing the movie BUG at the Florida Film Festival and let me say it was a real treat The Directors were there and they did a Q A afterwards The movie begins with a young boy smashing a roach beneath his foot a man who is nearby parking his car sees the young boy smash it and runs to ask the kid why why did he have to kill that living creature in his rush to counsel the youth in the error of his ways the man neglects to pay his parking meter which starts off a whole chain of events involving people not at all related to him some funny some sad and some ridiculous This movie has a lot of laughs Lots and there are many actors which you will recognize The main actors who stood out in the film for me were Jamie Kennedy from his comedy show the Jamie Kennedy Experiment playing a fortune cookie writer John Carroll Lynch who plays Drew s cross dressing brother on the Drew Carey show playing the animal loving guy who just can t get it right Brian Cox The original Hannibal Lecter in Manhunter playing the germaphobic owner of a Donut and Chinese Food Take Out joint There is one line where Cox tells his chef to wash off some pigs blood that is on the sidewalk by saying clean up that death which is quite funny mostly because of Cox s obsessed with germs delivery The funniest moment in the movie comes when a young boy imitates his father whom he heard earlier in the day yell out MotherF while in the classroom Another extremely funny and surreal scene is when Trudie Styler Mrs Sting herself and another actor perform a scene on a cable access show from the film the boy in the plastic bubble The actor who hosts the cable access show is just amazing he is so serious and deadpan and his performance as both the doctor and the boy in the plastic bubble is enthralling There are many other fine and funny actors and actresses in this film and having shot it in less than a month with a budget of just about million the directors Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi who are screenwriters by trade having written crazy beautiful and the upcoming Tuxedo starring Jackie Chan have achieved a film that is great funny and endearing
0	Ally McBeal was a decent enough show but it was very overrated The characters become boring after a while and the jokes begin to fall short I think it chose an appropriate point in time to leave it was starting to outstay its welcome
0	I almost never comment on movies but I saw the glowing reviews of this movie and decided I had to weigh in with my own review An instructor of mine received this film in the mail mixed in with his Academy screeners AMPAS aka the guys who vote on the Oscars and was so floored with how terribly constructed this movie was that he brought it in to our class to demonstrate to us how NOT to put together a movie This film has no plot the scenes are horribly horribly edited oftentimes using faux style picture in picture techniques and the performances particularly the lead who even fails at acting like a bad actress are for the most part obnoxious Someone truly failed to understand the point of an introduction namely the setting up of the plot There is no setup Halfway through the movie neither myself nor the rest of the class knew what this movie was supposed to be about The opening crane shot which sets up some kind of murder is never addressed and now that I think about it was possibly meant to be a flash forward with the rest of the film being a flashback but it cuts from that scene directly to the next without any indication as such Bah I could really go on and on At the very least this movie gives me renewed confidence in my own film making ability
1	The Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit together comprise the two best episodes of the new Doctor Who s second season Having said that it should be obvious that much of the story basically transposes the plot of Quatermass and the Pit to an outer space setting with the history of the universe intertwined with that of the Beast These episodes cement the emotional ties between Rose and the Doctor whilst also highlighting Rose s increasing self confidence establishing her as a not quite equal yet but getting there partner with our beloved Time Lord Also of note is Matt Jones elegant screenplay which decreases the occasional over reliance on one liners for the Doctor and the performances of the entire cast most notably the excellent Shaun Parkes as acting Captain Zachary Cross Flane
0	It should come as no shock to you when I say that Alone in the Dark is a crappy movie To put it bluntly it s as if a dung monster defecated ate the result and then vomited The final product would still outshine this movie Seemingly based on an ancient Atari video game the movie has something or other to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth the unleashing of demons and ancient civilizations Something about there being two worlds that of darkness and that of light Guess which one s ours Oh and years ago a really super duper advanced civilization opened the portal demons came over and had a blast then wiped out the civilization Which is why we ve never heard of them conveniently enough Christian Slater perhaps pining for the days of Heathers and Pump up the Volume plays Edward Carnby a paranormal researcher to whom Something Bad happened when he was years old He s hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of said advanced civilization Carnby used to be part of a secret institution called which has been trying to figure out what happened to that long ago civilization But Carnby believed he wasn t going to be able to find the answers he sought so he left the group But see these beasties are out and they get their prey in varying ways such as gutting them splitting them down the middle implanting neurological control devices in them or just turning them into killing zombies Yes it s another zombie movie That s about as distilled I can make the plot It s pretty convoluted and incomprehensible In similar movies one might see the intrepid researcher adventurer figure things out a step at a time and when we the audience are mentally with the researcher it s a lot of fun But when the scenes shift from attack to attack with no perspective or context not so much fun The acting is dreadful save for Slater who although he almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie showed he was capable of carrying the acting load He had to get this Tara Reid is cast as a museum curator Honest to goodness I thought I d seen the casting of a lifetime when Denise Richards was cast as a nuclear physicist in Tomorrow Never Dies But Reid here matches Richards crappy emoting for crappy emoting Hightlights include Reid pronouncing Newfoundland as New Fownd Land Reid delivering most of her lines in a dazed throaty monotone kinda like she d been on an all night bender for the past week before filming Reid a museum curator mind you spending a lot of the movie in a midriff bearing top and hip hugger jeans Oh yeah she was as believable as Jessica Simpson giving stock quotes Oh why must the pretty ones be so dumb Note I don t think Tara Reid s all that good looking She looks like she s in perpetual need of food Almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable except perhaps for Steven Dorff who played Burke one of the leaders of Dorff s character wasn t terribly well developed but nothing in the movie was from the sets to the characters to Tara Reid But I digress Anyway the perplexing and utterly preposterous storyline is tough enough to follow with the film moving at such a breakneck pace but director Uwe Boll tosses in a pounding mind deadening soundtrack it s so loud you can t hear what the actors are saying in some of the scenes That can t be right Given the acting level however perhaps thanks are in order to Mr Boll Oh and a fun note The opening moments of the movie include narration of the words that are crawling across the screen at the same time Remember the first Star Wars You heard that now familiar Star Wars theme while the prologue crawled There was surely no need for narration why do I need some doofus to read what s on the screen for me Were the producers simply looking out for blind people Maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud they were also looking out for hard of hearing people Also the narrator inexplicably had a lisp for the first few lines of the crawl then lost it Bizarre Alone in the Dark is a loud dopey mishmash of dreadful acting an incoherent script and ham handed directing Hardly a note rings true There s so much chaos that the audience simply gives up caring about the characters and roots for their demise Even in the dark the demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed by comparison Ironically since there were only three other people in the theater I watched this Alone in the Dark I wonder if Uwe Boll planned it that way I can t quite give this the lowest rating because I had low hopes for it to begin with and because it never grabbed me enough for me to get worked up about it It s atrocious although Slater redeems himself a tiny bit
1	THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT like I M ALL RIGHT JACK takes a dim view of both labor and capital Alec Guinness is a scientific genius but an eccentric one he has never gotten his university degree due to an err accident in a college laboratory He manages to push himself into various industrial labs in the textile industry When the film begins he is in Michael Gough s company and Gough in a memorable moment is trying to impress his would be father in law Cecil Parker by showing him the ship shape firm he runs While having lunch with Parker and Parker s daughter Joan Greenwood Gough gets a message regarding some problems about the lab s unexpectedly large budget problems He reads the huge expenditures due to Guinness s experiments and chokes on his coffee Guinness goes on to work at Parker s firm and repeats the same tricks he did with Gough but Parker discovers it too Greenwood has discovered what Guinness is working on and convinces Parker to continue the experiments but now legally The result Guinness and his assistant has apparently figured out how to make an artificial fiber that can constantly change the electronic bonds within it s molecular structure so that for all intents and purposes the fiber will remain in tact for good Any textile made from it will never fade get dirty or wear out it will last forever Guinness has support from a female shop steward but not her chief He sees Guinness as selling out to the rich But when he explains to them what he s done they turn against him If everyone has clothes that will last forever then they will not need new clothes Soon Parkers fellow textile tycoons led by Gough Ernest Theisinger in a wonderful performance and Howard Marion Crawford are equally panic stricken by what may end their businesses They seek to suppress the invention With only Greenwood in his corner although Parker sort of sympathizes with him Guinness tries to get the news of his discovery to the public In the end Guinness is defeated by science as well as greed But he ends the film seeing the error in his calculations and we guess that one day he may still pull off his discovery after all It s a brilliant comedy But is the argument for suppression valid At one point the difficulties of making the textile are shown you have to heat the threads to a high temperature to actually enable the ends of the material to be united There is nothing that shows the cloth will stretch if the owner gets fat or contract if the owner gets thin Are we to believe that people only would want one set of clothing for ever What happened to fashion changes and new styles And the cloth is only made in the color white making Guinness look like a white knight We are told that color dye would have to be added earlier in the process Wouldn t that have an effect on the chemical reactions that maintain the structure of the textile Alas this is not a science paper but a film about the hypocrisies of labor and capital in modern industry As such it is brilliant But those questions I mention keep bothering me about the validity of suppressing Guinness invention
1	Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites It is amazing how much he throws himself in each of the characters he plays making them real I remember many years ago we had a party in our house the friends came over we were sitting around the table eating drinking the wine talking laughing having a good time The TV was on there was a movie which we did not pay much attention to Then suddenly all of us stopped talking and laughing The glasses did not clink the forks did not move the food was getting cold on the plates We could not take our eyes off the screen where the young crippled man whose entire body was against him and who only had a control over his left foot picked up a piece of chalk with his foot and for what seemed the eternity tried to write just one word on the floor When he finished writing that one word we all knew that we had witnessed not one but three triumphs the triumph of a human will and spirit the triumph of the cinema which was able to capture the moment like this on the film and the triumph of an actor who did not act but who became his character Jim Sheridan s My Left Foot is an riveting unsentimental bio drama about Christy Brown the man who was born with cerebral palsy in a Dublin slum who became an artist and a writer and who found a love of his life I like every one of Day Lewis s performances I have mixed feelings about his performance in GONY but I believe that his greatest role was Christy Brown in My Left Foot
0	This was an awful movie Not for the subject matter but for the delivery I went with my girlfriend at the time when the movie came out expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression What we saw was hours of brutal police oppression with no uplift at the end The previews and ads made NO mention of this Plus for all that they played up whoopi goldberg my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first minutes Again the previews say nothing about this not that you would expect that but it s just more of the problem If I had known how depressing this movie would be I would ve never have seen it Or at least I would ve been prepared for it This was a bait and switch ad campaign and I will NEVER see this movie again
1	This was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption I loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family Well acted and well directed If there were any flaws I d have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again What about all people of all cultural backgrounds I would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown like in real life Nevertheless the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker Loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes
0	Blood Surf AKA Krocodylus is a fair film that has an okay cast which includes Dax Miller Taryn Reif Kate Fischer Duncan Regehr Joel West Matt Borlenghi Maureen Larrazabal Cris Vertido Susan Africa Archie Adamos Rolando Santo Domingo and Malecio Amayao The acting by the actors is fairly good The thrills are fairly good and some of it is surprising The movie is filmed fairly good as well Same thing goes for the music The film is fairly interesting and the movie does keeps you going until the end This is a fairly thrilling film If you the the cast in the film Monsters Giant Animal films Horror Thrillers Mystery and interesting films then I recommend you to see this film today
1	This has to be one of the best if not the best film i have seen for a very very long time Had enough action to satisfy an fan and yet the plot was very good I really enjoyed the film and had me hooked from start to finish Added blood and gore in there but brought the realistic nature of what happens to the front of the film and even had a tear jerker ending for many people i should think It is a must watch for anyone Seen many reviews slating the film but to be fair most the films that get bad reviews turn out to be some of the best this proves it once again Rent this film buy this film just go out and watch this film You will not be disappointed
1	Hello This movie is well okay Just kidding ITS AWESOME It s NOT a Block Buster smash hit It s not meant to be But its a big hit in my world And my sisters We are rockin Rollers GO RAMONES This is a great movie For ME
0	I love killer Insects movies they are great fun to watch I had to watch this movie as it was one of my Favourite horror books by Shaun Hutson I have met him and I wish I did listen to him as this movie was terrible like he Said it was after he said that I was still dying to see how bad it was The plot People are dying mysteriously and gruesomely and nobody has a clue what the cause is Only health worker Mike Brady has a possible solution but his theory of killer slugs is laughed at by the authorities Only when the body count begins to rise and a slug expert from England begins snooping around does it begin to look like Mike had the right idea after all This movie as the most overacting you ever see a movie Slugs in this movie are fast Then normal and it looks like they fast forwarding the scenes This movie is nothing like the book at all the book was ten times scarier ten times gory and had a lot more story to it I didn t like this movie at all As I am huge fan of Slugs the book and second book called Breeding ground Both of books are Great Read the book then watch the movie you may like more then I did Give this out
0	That s the sound of Stan and Ollie spinning in their graves I won t bother listing the fundamental flaws of this movie as they re so obvious they go without saying Small things like this being The All New Adventures of Laurel and Hardy despite the stars being dead for over thirty years when it was made Little things like that A bad idea would be to have actors playing buffoons whom just happen to be called Laurel and Hardy As bad as that is it might have worked For a really bad idea try casting two actors to impersonate the duo Okay they might claim to be nephews but the end result is the same Bronson Pinchot can be funny Okay forget his wacky foreigner Cousin Larry schtick in Perfect Strangers and look at him in True Romance Here though he stinks It s probably not all his fault and like the director and the support cast all of who are better than the material he was probably just desperate for money There are those who claim Americans find it difficult to master an effective English accent This cause is not helped here by Pinchot What is Stan Welsh Iranian Pakistani Only in Stan s trademark yelp does he come close though as the yelp is overdone to the point of tedium that s nothing to write home about Gailard Sartain does slightly better as Ollie though it s like saying what s worse stepping in dog dirt or a kick in the knackers Remember the originals with their split second timing intuitive teamwork and innate loveability Well that s absent altogether replaced with two stupid old men and jokes so mistimed you could park a bus through the gaps Whereas the originals had plots that could be summed up in a couple of panels this one has some long winded Mummy hokum and what a lousy title that s mixed in with the boys fraternity scenario I can t claim to have seen every single one of Laurel and Hardy s movies but I think it s a safe bet that even their nadir was leagues ahead of this Maybe the major problem is that the originals were sort of playing themselves or at least using their own accents It at least felt natural and unforced as opposed to the contrived caricatures Pinchot and Sartain are given And since when did Stan do malapropisms and so many at that I was gonna give you a standing cremation I would like to marinate my friend Stop it Only notable moment is a reference to Bozo the Clown the cartoon character who shared Larry Harmon s L H comic Harmon of course bought the name copyright how disconcerting to see a after Laurel and Hardy and was co director and producer of this travesty Questions abound Would Stan and Ollie do fart gags if they were alive today Would they glass mummies with broken bottles Have Stan being smacked in the genitals with a spear and end on a big CGI finale Let s hope not I did laugh once but I think that was just in disbelief at how terrible it all is Why was this film made in the first place Who did the makers think would like it Possibly the worst movie I ve ever seen an absolute abhorrence I grew sick of watching after just the first five minutes About as much fun as having your head trapped in a vice while a red hot poker and stinging nettles are forcibly inserted up your back passage
1	I was not expecting much from this movie but was very pleasantly surprised as it is light and funny and very well observed The central trio of deadbeat bikers were surprisingly likable as they staggered and clowned their way through their drug centred trip to Wales The humour was gentle and subtle as indeed were the three characters witness their sympathetic treatment of the little old lady shopkeeper The atmospherics of rural Wales were captured perfectly and the soundtrack was very well chosen Cleverly and carefully scripted with great attention to detail I have never seen such a realistic portrayal of alternative culture I felt I was there with them Very light in touch and full of fun not what you might expect from a movie about bikers and drugs A delight on all fronts and difficult to criticise though I thought the last two scenes were a bit lame the film should have ended when they left Wales But overall an unexpected treasure of a film
0	Well I have to admit this was one of my favorites as a kid when I used to watch it on a home projector as a super reel Now there isn t much to recommend it other than the inherent camp value of actors being terrified by replicas of human skulls The special effects are pretty silly mostly consisting of skulls on wires and superimposed ghost images But there s something to be said for the sets The large mansion in which it takes place is pretty creepy especially since it s mostly unfurnished probably due to budgetary reasons It definitely inspires more laughs than screams however Just try not to get the giggles when the wife who does more than her share of screaming goes into the greenhouse and is confronted with the ghost of her husband s ex
1	Part II or formerly known as GUERILLA is also a great achievement but not quite as entertaining as PART I because this is where we begin to witness what might have caused the fall and death of Che Guevara Once again I m impressed by the cause and effect that both parts have in their interconnecting stories We re reminded again and again that the lead character Che Guevara is an Argentine Some of the men in Fidel s army chose not to take orders from a Foreigner and now that Che has chosen to leave the comfort of victory to continue the revolutionary in Bolivia he doesn t get much respect from his new army and the natives either only because he s a foreigner As far as technical goes I think Part II would ve been more helpful if before everything else right after the display of the map it would show some highlights from the previous installment just to refresh memory about his characters and what he s set himself on doing to make the audience understand why his methods was successful in Cuba but they don t work in Bolivia It is clear now in this segment that Che is not as charismatic as Fidel Castro In Bolivia he s dealing with a bunch of soldiers whose hearts are not fully in it It s said that the ingredient for revolutionary is love well they don t give a damn that much about their country so it s a tough sell It s excruciatingly painful and difficult for Che to get the others to buy into his vision I like one particular scene that illustrates Che s deteriorating condition a scene in which his horse would not go no matter how badly Che tries to direct it and then his temper took the better of him and for a moment there he forgets he s a doctor and he becomes this desperate soldier who s stabs his own horse His army is like a horse that doesn t want to be led But at the same time the film drags it relies on small cameos from familiar faces that you ll recognize just for the sake of brief entertainment and for the most part you get pounded left and right by one obstacle after another but maybe that is the intention of Part II if so then it definitely works Standing ovation to the cinematography that gives us a first person view at the moment of Che s last breath This movie may not answer the questions of why Che Guevara was so stubborn why he was so determined he could pull it off even wen the odds were against him and why he deeply wants South America to have the same fate as Cuba but the movie CHE is a story worth telling
1	There is so much that can be said about this film It is not your typical nunsploitation Of course there is nudity and sex with nuns but that is almost incidental to the story It is set in th Century Italy at the time of the martyrdom of Christians at Otranto The battle between the Muslims and the Christians takes up a good part of the film It was interesting when everyone was running from the Muslim hoards that the mother superior would ask Why do you fear the Muslims they will not do anything that the Christians have done to you Certainly there was enough torture on both sides Sister Flavia Florinda Bolkan is sent to a convent for defying her father In the process she witnesses and endures many things the gelding of a stallion the rape of a local woman by a new Duke the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit by the Tarantula Sect and a whipping herself when she ran off with a Jew The torture was particularly gruesome with hot wax being poured on the nun and her nipples cut off Sister Flavia is bound to continue to get into trouble as she questions the male dominated society in which she lives She even asks Jesus why the father son and holy ghost are all men Eventually she joins the leader of the Muslims as his lover and they sack the convent Here is where you see more flesh than you can possible enjoy at one time But tragedy is to come She manages to exact sweet revenge on all including the Duke and her father but finds that the Muslim lover treats her exactly the same She is a woman and that is all there is to it I won t describe what the holy men of the church did to this heretic at the end but it predates the torture of Saw or Hostel by decades Nunsploitation fans will be satisfied with the treats but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest
0	This movie is so so so horrible that it makes angels lose their wings Shaq had tried to make other crossover efforts like his work in Shaq Fu for the NES and his plethora of unbearable rap albums and later the epic serving of horrible film making that is Steel There s not a single good thing to be said about this movie I saw it a bunch of times when I was very young but I must ve been an idiot then because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart It s fun to mock I saw it on the Disney Channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that Although once the thrill of mocking it is done you still become overwhelmed by its terribleness If you see it on TV try this consider as your watching the film removing from it all the scenes in which Shaq uses his magical genie powers If you do that it becomes like a film about a pedophile chasing a kid and rapping to seduce him That s kinda funny and disturbing A horrible example of film Do not unless looking to mock it see this movie
1	This movie with the alternate title Martial Law for some reason introduced me to Jeff Wincott for the first time And it was a great introduction Although I had never heard of him before he seemed to be an excellent fighter The action scenes in this movie are GREAT There are lots of them too by the way The recruit fight at the Peacekeepers HQ is especially good There s just something about one single guy beating the crap out of a bunch of people that s really fun And for the rest of the cast Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for the villain Roles like this fits her but others don t Matthias Hues also did a good job as always He s a great fighter and macho like character and was a good rival for Wincott in this movie
1	I was an usherette in an old theater in Northern California when this movie came out As good as it is on DVD it s even more eerie and terrifying on the big screen Although it has been about years since I have seen it it is still one of my all time favorites At the risk of sounding trite They just don t make em like this anymore If Sixth Sense freaked you out at all this movie is definitely for you Great storyline incredible cast of characters ominous setting even the soundtrack has a haunting quality to it I highly recommend you not watch it alone What a brownstone apartment was renting for in alone will have you gasping it would be at least times that price today
0	When George C Scott played the title role in Patton you saw him directing tanks with pumps of his fist shooting at German dive bombers with a revolver and spewing profanity at superiors and subordinates alike The most action we get from Gregory Peck as MacArthur a figure from the same war of debatably greater accomplishment is when he taps mapboards with his finger and raises that famous eyebrow of his Comparing Peck s performance with Scott s may be unfair Yet the fact MacArthur was made by the same producer and scored by the same composer begs parallels as does the fact both films open with the generals addressing cadets at West Point It s clear to me the filmmakers were looking to mimic that Oscar winning film of a few years before But while Peck looks the part more than Scott ever did he comes off as mostly bland in a story that feels less like drama than a Wikipedia walkthrough of MacArthur s later career To this day there are those who think he was a dangerous demagogue and others who say he was one of the greatest men who ever lived an opening title crawl tells us It s a typical dishwater bit of post Vietnam sophistry about those who led America s military very much of its time but what we get here is neither view MacArthur as presented here doesn t anger or inspire the way he did in life Director Joseph Sargent who went on to helm the famous turkey Jaws The Revenge does a paint by numbers job with bland battle montages and some obvious set use as when the Chinese attack U S forces in Korea while the script by Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins trots out a MacArthur who comes across as good natured to the point of blandness a bit too caught up in his public image but never less than decent Here you see him stepping off the landing craft making his return to the Phillipines There you see him addressing Congress in his Old Soldiers Never Die speech For a long stretch of time he sits in a movie theater in Toyko waiting for the North Koreans to cross the th parallel so we can get on with the story while newsreel footage details Japan s rise from the ashes under his enlightened rule Peck s co actors Marj Dusay as his devoted wife you re my finest soldier and Nicolas Coaster as a loyal aide burnish teary eyes in the direction of their companion s magnificence but garner no interest on their own Even when he argues with others Peck never raises his voice and for the most part wins his arguments with thunderous eloquence When Admiral Nimitz suggests delaying the recapture of the Philippines a point of personal pride as well as tactical concern for MacArthur MacArthur comes back with the comment Just now as I listened to his plan I thought I saw our flag going down Doubtless the real Nimitz would have had something to say about that but the character in the movie just bows his head and meekly accepts the insult in the presence of President Roosevelt The only person in the movie who MacArthur seriously disagrees with is Harry S Truman who Ed Flanders does a fine job with despite a prosthetic nose that makes him resemble Toucan Sam Truman s firing of MacArthur should be a dramatic high point but here it takes place in a quiet dinner conversation in which Peck plays MacArthur as nothing less than a genial martyr I ve never been sold by Peck s standing at the upper pantheon of screen stars he delivers great presence but lacks complexity even in many of his best known roles But it s unfair to dock him so much here as he gets little help defining MacArthur as anything other than a speechifying bore Except for two scenes one where he rails against the surrender of the Philippines He struck Old Glory and ran up a bedsheet and another where he has a mini breakdown while awaiting the U S invasion of Inchon inveighing against Communists undermining him at the White House Peck really plays Peck here not the complex character who inspired the famous sobriquet American Caesar The real MacArthur might have been worthy of such a comparison What you get here is less worthy of Shakespeare than Shakes the Clown
0	This film is not deserved of the next few minutes I will spend criticizing it but I know many people like myself rely on IMDb com to assist in deciding on films For that reason alone I am writing this Live Feed is like an Asian version of s The Incredible Torture Show aka Blood Sucking Freaks http www imdb com title tt Torture dismemberment murder cannibalism sure it s all here along with a third grade script pathetic acting and a perverted failure of an attempt at black comedy The film takes place in China yet everyone speaks English There is an abundance of girls in the film who are horrified by the butchering of dogs in a marketplace yet are sexually excited about entering a porno parlor One gal who is disgusted by the filth in a restroom stall moments later is still there having at it with her friends boyfriend how he even got in there might be the only engaging thing about this whole film The film is absolutely awful even for a B movie Even if you were to download it for free it would be an insult to your hard drive
1	Lloyd Bridges as Mike Nelson and his boat were all the stars of this series What made it so good to me when I watched it was the real feel of going underwater The show exhibits a youthful energy energy for exploration under water which is infectious The show was educational as well showing the viewer things about scuba diving from someone who appeared to be a consummate pro Mike Nelson There were excellent shows and the program always appeared to be well produced Granted the drama in the scripts sometimes hit the same notes in more than episode but each show holds it s own with any other show produced during this era the infancy of American television
0	I must say that I was disapointed with this film I have never been a huge BNL fans I find their songs kind of childish and obsessively nostalgic this is me in grade if i had a million dollars shoe box of life etc However I have seen clips of their live show and I really like the improvisational and goofy nature of the show I was hoping that this movie would highlight this which is unfortunately the most interesting part of the show because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling there is a standup bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and boring despite how much Jim Creegan was digging himself The film does not and shows only a few minutes of it and you know they ve had better moments as in the Afgahnistan concert Koffee Anan he s the man in charge my name s Steve Paige and I m really large BNL are kind of like when I went to Europe a few years ago and heard that godawfull Blue song by Effeil or whatever every minutes I came back to Canada and then a month later that song was all over the place again I nearly chewed off my own arm BNL is like that years ago I remember many a fond memory of sitting around campfires in Canada listening to people play If I had a million dollars BNL was a cult phenomenon in Canada and much of their humour has a particular Canadian slant to it Kraft Dinner is a staple for many students up here and the name Gordon is quintessentially Canadian a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and I was somewhat gratefull Then all of a sudden they become huge in States and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band yeah they re brand new but they re all in their s while the rest of Canada is going Oh geez I thought those guys folded years ago do I have to listen to million dollars again The concert footage is not bad but I would have liked to have seen more of their stage routine the shooting is not that great and things like clips from their massive free show in Boston are glazed over much too quickly The interviews are surprisingly dull for such a funny bunch of guys I think they re all old and they have families and houses and stuff and have settled down a bit There are times when they go into Spinal Tap type of material where they deliver deadpan satire then they break into laughs and giggles that kind of ruins it The interviews with Moses Znaimer a Canadian media mogule and Terry David Mulligan Music dude are extremely pretentious and verge into Tap territory unintentionally This movie doesn t really document very much either I mean it s basically one show and at the start of the film they are already huge and have a massive touring entourage it s not like we see them rising from obscurity and surprise they are popular it s a methodically planned out event so in the end it s rather lifeless kind of half live concert half documentary and not much of either
0	This movie had potential and I was willing to give it a try but there are so many timeline problems that are so obvious it s hard to swallow being treated like such an idiot Rise to Power is set in the late sixties Carlito s Way is set in the mid to late seventies For this movie to be realistic it would have to be set in the fifties if not the late forties Rise to Power has no sign of Gail Pennelope Ann Miller no sign of Kleinfeld no sign of Rolando that Carlito supposedly ran with in his hey day None of the primary characters in the original film were in this movie We re supposed to believe that Carlito met all these people in the span of a few years Rise to Power ends with Carlito walking down the beach talking about retiring in paradise which is what he wanted to do in the original film Also the pre quel creates the Rocco and Earl characters what s supposed to happen with them since they are clearly not in Carlito s Way It s also hard to understand how Carlito could have the relationship with the Italians he has in the original film watching the events of Rise to Power Where are the Taglialucci s in this film There is probably seven years between the two films and he spends five of them in prison It s like trying to put a square plug into a round hole It is obvious that no one was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in making some bucks by making an average gangster film and throwing a character called Carlito Brigante into the story The film had some good moments but I think they would have been better off leaving this movie to stand by itself instead of trying to make it a prequel to Carlito s Way If you feel determined to see this movie the only advice I can give is to not think of the movie as a linear pre quel Think of it like the spaghetti westerns with Clint Eastwood s man with no name in other words two movies that have the same character but aren t necessarily connected with each other
1	I gather from reading the previous comments that this film went straight to cable Well I paid to see it in a theatre and I m glad I did because visually it was a striking film Most of the settings seem like they were made in the early s except for the shrink s office which was dated in a different way and if you leave the Neve Campbell sequences out the whole film has a washed out early s ambience And the use of restaurants in the film was fascinating For a first time director whose background I believe is in writing he has a great eye Within the first ten minutes I felt the plot lacked plausibility so I just willingly suspended my disbelief and went along for the ride In terms of acting and the depiction of father son mother son husband wife parent child relationships the film was spot on William H Macy a pleasure to watch seems to be filling the void left by the late Tony Perkins if this and Magnolia are any indication Tracey Ullman as the neglected wife was quite moving to me It was a three dimensional depiction of a character too often viewed by society as two dimensional Of course Donald Sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable portrayals The depiction of the parents Bain Sutherland reminded me in an indirect way of Vincent Gallo s BUFFALO although toned down quite a bit I would definitely pay money to see a second film from this director He has the self discipline of a s b crimefilm director something P T Anderson will never have yet he has a visual style and a way with actors that commands attention
1	The word classic is thrown around too loosely nowadays but this movie well deserves the appelation The combination of Neil Simon Walter Matthau possibly the world s best living comic actor and the late lamented George Burns make for a comic masterpiece It is interesting to contemplate what the movie would have been like had not death prevented Jack Benny from playing George Burns part as had been planned As it is the reunion scene in Matthau s apartment is not likely to be surpassed as a sidesplitter Definitely one of my desert island films Enter
0	We all know a movie never does complete justice to the book but this is exceptional Important characters were cut out Blanca and Alba were essentially mushed into the same character most of the subplots and major elements of the main plot were eliminated Clara s clairvoyance was extremely downplayed making her seem like a much more shallow character than the one I got to know in the book In the book we learn more about her powers and the important effects she had on so many people which in turn was a key element in the life of the family In the movie she was no more than some special lady The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero Tercero third by the way is the son and thus comes after Segundo second and its connections to that between Esteban and his grandson from Pancha Garc a not son who he also did recognize is chopped in half and its importance downplayed One of the most fundamental things about the book that the film is all but stripped of this is called The House of the Spirits Where is the house The story of generations of a family is supposed to revolve around the big house on the corner a line stated so many times in the novel The house in fundamental to the story but the movie unjustly relegates it to a mere backdrop If I hadn t read the book before I would have never guessed that such a sappy shallow movie could be based on such a rich and entertaining novel
0	Despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes Where were the Japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants Not on the payroll apparently A Japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes In a later conversation she said Imagine a Finnish director making a movie in Fnnish about the American Civil War using blond Swedish actors as union Army and Frenchmen as the Confederates Worse imagine dressing the Scarlet O Hara female lead in a period hoop skirt missing the hoop and sporting a s hairdo Maybe some people in Finland might not realize that the hoop skirt was missing the hoop or recognize the bizarre Jane Mansfield hair but in Atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears and be laughing in the aisles excellent story and photography be damned So watching Memoirs of a Geisha was painful for anyone familiar with Japanese cultural nuances actual geisha or Japanese dress and that was the topic of the movie Hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making They frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong I thought The Last Samurai was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on Japan could be Memoirs of a Geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time

0	A stupid rich guy circa about wants to visit a nearby mental asylum to see how a famous doctor cares for his patients Despite an initially hostile response he is soon cordially invited in and given a tour by the good doctor And as the doctor shows him about he talks and talks and talks And as he talks loonies run amok here and there doing nothing especially productive While there is SOME action here and there and some of it quite disturbing it s amazing how dull and cerebral the whole thing is lacking life and energy which is odd for a horror flick Even a guy who thinks he s a chicken and dresses like one becomes rather tiresome The further this tour takes the guest the more disturbing it becomes until ultimately you realize that the inmates have taken over the hospital and are torturing their keepers Yet again despite this twist the film is amazingly lifeless in many places particularly when it moves very slowly as a bizarre ceremony is taking place or people are just wandering about the set Only when the workers from the asylum found in a prison cell starving does the film have any real impact Considering this plot it sure is hard to imagine making it boring but the people who made this cheap exploitational film have Now with the same plot and competent writing acting and direction this COULD have been an interesting and worthwhile film You know now that I think about it this was the plot of one of the episodes of the original Star Trek TV show You know the one with Lord Garth Master of the Universe and Kirk and Spock are held prisoner by this madman and his crazed followers A final note The film has quite a bit of nudity here and there and includes a rape scene so be forewarned it s not for kids In fact considering how worthless the film is it isn t for anyone However with the version included in the Movie Pack Chilling Classics the print is so incredibly bad that it s hard to see all this flesh due to the print being so very dark
1	Picture the classic noir story lines infused with hyper stylized black and white visuals of Frank Miller s Sin City Then picture a dystopian science fiction thriller such as Steven Spielberg s Minority Report or Richard Linklater s A Scanner Darkly An amalgamation of the above would be a suitable way of describing visionary french director Christian Volckman s bleak and atmospheric take on the future in his feature film debut But although Volckman s work does unquestionably take reference from the aforementioned films and those similar to them such a simplistic hybrid does not do Renaissance Volckman s end result justice the film itself is a far more complex piece of work than that Genre hybridity is usually a hit and miss affair especially in a contemporary context with the well of individuality appearing to be increasingly exhausted As such Renaissance is laudable as a cinematic experiment at the very least with its unique interspersing of the gritty nihilism of the neo noir detective thriller and the fantastic allegorical terror of the dystopian sci fi drama which serve to compliment each other s storytelling conventions in a strangely fitting fashion The screenplay is a clever and intriguing one although one gets the sense that many of the lines in the script would have been much more effective in their original french than the English translation the film s title also becomes far more poignant managing to stay one step ahead of its audience all the way through Though many elements of the plot will seem quite familiar to those who frequent such science fiction thrillers the script throws unexpected twists and turns in at exactly the right moment to keep the viewer on their toes making for a truly compelling work Volckman s film truly excels in its visual component and the stunning black and white animation is easily the film s highlight superbly moody and stylish it goes to show what tremendous aesthetic effect the simple use of two shades can have With tremendous detail paid to the composition and look of each shot and superb use of very noir shadows and intriguing angles to accentuate the emotional tension of the scene the film appears straight out of a Frank Miller comic but with a twist the end result being consistently visually sumptuous The film s English rendition is also given added credence by its very fitting array of voice casting The gruff voice of Daniel Craig is an absolutely perfect piece of casting for grim stoic policeman Karas and Catherine McCormack is a strong presence as the mysterious woman whose sister s disappearance he is investigating Despite a wavering English accent Romola Garai does great work as the frantic sister in question and Jonathan Pryce is suitably menacing as the shady head of ominous mega corporation Avalon Ian Holm s reedy voice is also a strong choice as a mysterious scientist and Holm makes a powerful impression in his brief scenes All together Renaissance boasts a visually stunning unique and compelling futuristic thriller just as intelligent as it is entertaining Though the plot may seem familiar to those who frequent such fare and the occasional weak line may inhibit the film from being the moody masterpiece it set out to be the superb animation in itself easily carries the film through its occasional qualms For fans of either of the film s intertwined genres or the gritty graphic novels of Frank Miller or those willing to appreciate a capably crafted slightly less conventional take on the futuristic thriller the film is without question worth a watch
1	I had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago but its concept interested me when I heard it an American man meets a European woman on his last night in Europe and they spend the night together talking It sparked my interest but I never expected it to be this great Before Sunrise is a masterpiece and it s also one of the most romantic films on record To my surprise it completely lacked the cynicism of the s It s impossible to really talk too much about it since there is no real plot so to speak although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about it is sort of like My Dinner With Andre where there is a conversation but it s not JUST the conversation that matters but let me just say see it SEE IT
0	Iam a Big fan of Mr Ram Gopal Varma but i could not believe that he made this movie i was really disappointed Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag doesn t come anywhere close to the real Sholay It does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer Ram Gopal Varma fails to create chemistry between the characters There is no camaraderie between Heero Ajay Devgan and Raj Prashant raj There are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal face off is remarkable Amitabh Bachchan should not have done this movie Ajay and Sushmita sen was trying their best but no use Rajpal Yadav s voice modulation ineffective and rather pointless Mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language Rest of the cast was below expectation The comedy situation which was adapted from the original sholay fall flat in this movie Ram Gopal Varma could have worked upon the script but because of the controversies surrounded against the movie he messed up and just for the sake of making he made this Aag But there is no fire

tackle with his extraordinary and unique Shovel fighting style The Blue Raja Hank Azaria sells silverware to newlyweds by day and flings tableware at crackpot villians by night if his mom isn t keeping him busy with the latest snooping Mr Furious works in a junk yard to earn his pay then takes out his frustration on his friends at night tossing ill conceived one liners at friend and foe alike and threatening to get really angry leaving everyone to wonder So What Ben Stiller breathes such life into this character you can t help but love him These three spend their nights trying to capture that moment of glory they ve dreamed about becoming real Super Heroes Obviously it could happen Champion City has Captain Amazing after all a flying fighting super cop with enough corporate logos on his costume to stop an extra bullet or two Greg Kinnear turns in a stellar performance as a middle aged sellout trying to recapture his fans attention in the twilight of his career To bring back that extra magic that might win the endorsements again C A frees Casanova Frankenstein a WAAAAAY over the top menace played to chilling perfection by Goeffrey Rush This lunatic genius has created a psychofrakulator to warp Champion City into a reflection of his own insanities and ends up capturing C A within hours of his release from prison This leaves only the Mystery Men to stop Frankenstein s evil plan but with such henchmen as the Disco Boys protecting Frankenstein the trio are going to need a little help Recruiting commences and after a painful recruitment party the team settles in with The Bowler Janeane Garofolo who initially has the only real talent in the team with her mystic bowling ball seemingly animated by the vengeful spirit of her dead father the Invisible Boy Kel Mitchell who CLAIMS to turn invisible when ABSOLUTELY NO ONE is looking at him the Spleen Paul Reubens granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy and the much underused Sphinx Wes Studi who is shown to be able to cut guns in half with his mind then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over wise This film really is a cross genre romp Anyone wanting to pigeon hole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle This is a spoof parody of the superhero genre from the pseudo Burton sets recycled endlessly and occasionally decorated with more spoof material to the ridiculous costumes the comic book genre gets a pretty good send up But at the same time it is a serious superhero flick as well Both at once While not a necessarily unique idea in itself for example this movie is in some ways reflective of D C Comic s short lived Inferior Five work it is fairly innovative for the big screen It offers the comic book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway then throws in the inevitable wanna bes and we all know if superheroes were real so would these guys be real If the Big Guy with the S were flying around New York City you d see a half dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis Sure the Shoveller fights pretty well and the Blue Raja hurls forks with great accuracy all parts of the super hero world But does that make them genuine super heroes Only in their minds This movie is also a comedy albeit a dark one Inevitable when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super heroics One liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of Particularly marvelous is the dialogue by Janeane Garofalo with her bowling ball father Yet it isn t a comedy in the sense of side splitting laughter or eternally memorable jokes It mixes in a dose of drama of discovery and of romance but never really ventures fully into any of it What really makes Mystery Men a good film in the end is that it is very engaging The weak lame good guys are eventually justified and for one shining moment really become super heroes justice is served and the movie ends with a scene that reeks of realism as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise If the viewer stops trying to label the film then the film can be a great romp Of course no movie is perfect Claire Forlani comes off as bored and directionless as Mr Furious love interest in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience Tom Waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor Dr Heller although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone And the villians are never more than gun toting lackeys a point of which is made in the film The cinematography is choppy and disjointed such as happens in the average comic book so it is excusable the music sometimes overpowers the scenery and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well Yet overall this film is incredible You probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie but it s a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest in my opinion
1	In the tradition of G Men The House On nd Street The Street With No Name now comes The FBI Story one of those carefully supervised films that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best possible light While it s year director J Edgar Hoover was alive it would be showed in no other kind of light The book by Don Whitehead that this film is based on is a straight forward history of the bureau from it s founding in until roughly the time the film The FBI Story came out It s important sometimes to remember there WAS an FBI before J Edgar Hoover headed it Some of that time is covered in the film as well But Warner Brothers was not making a documentary so to give the FBI flesh and blood the fictional character of John Chip Hardesty was created Hardesty as played by James Stewart is a career FBI man who graduated law school and rather than go in practice took a job with the bureau in the early twenties In real life the Bureau was headed by William J Burns of the Burns Private Detective Agency It was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film Burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the Harding administration When Hoover was appointed in to bring professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence in he did just that Through the Hardesty family which is Stewart and wife Vera Miles we see the history of the FBI unfold In addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the FBI s story itself Stewart and Miles are most assuredly an all American couple We follow the FBI through some of the cases Stewart is involved with arresting Ku Klux Klan members a plot to murder oil rich Indians bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties their involvement with apprehending Nazi sympathizers in World War II and against Communist espionage in the Cold War There is a kind of prologue portion where Stewart tells a class at the FBI Academy before going into the history of the bureau as it intertwines with his own That involves a bomb placed on an airline by a son who purchased a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight Nick Adams will give you the creeps as the perpetrator and the story is sadly relevant today Of course if The FBI Story were written and produced today it would reflect something different and not so all American Still the FBI does have a story to tell and it is by no means a negative one The FBI Story is not one of Jimmy Stewart s best films but it s the first one I ever saw with my favorite actor in it so it has a special fondness for me If the whole FBI were made up Jimmy Stewarts I d feel a lot better about it There s also a good performance by Murray Hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who is killed in a shootout with Baby Face Nelson Vera Miles didn t just marry Stewart she in fact married the FBI as the film demonstrates It s dated mostly but still has a good and interesting story to tell
0	While not as bad as his game to movie adaptations this hunk of crud doesn t fare much better Boll seems to have a pathological inability to accept that he doesn t make good movies One of these days he ll run out of money and stop inflicting the world with his bombs The acting was sub par the dialog sounded like they were reading TelePrompTers and Boll s special little touches were seen throughout the whole thing Like all Uwe Boll movies this one just shouldn t exist Plain and simple Just like Uwe Boll himself shouldn t exist
1	In the very first episode of Friends which aired Sept The One Where Monica Gets A Roommate there is a song playing as Rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show the line that plays is If you ever need holding does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song It is seems as if it is a great song I would love to get a copy of it Thanks for the assistance I am looking for the album cd it is on so I can purchase it I have the shows which are available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over again It just seemed to be believable thanks for the hours of entertainment you have provided over the years
0	Dumb is as dumb does in this thoroughly uninteresting supposed black comedy Essentially what starts out as Chris Klein trying to maintain a low profile eventually morphs into an uninspired version of The Three Amigos only without any laughs In order for black comedy to work it must be outrageous which Play Dead is not In order for black comedy to work it cannot be mean spirited which Play Dead is What Play Dead really is is a town full of nut jobs Fred Dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton s character from A Simple Plan while Jake Busey does a pretty fair imitation of well Jake Busey MERK
0	OK forget all the technical inconsisties or the physical impossibilities of the Space Shuttle accidentally being launched by a quirky robot with a heart of gold Forget the hideous special effects and poorly constructed one dimensional characters Just looking at the premise of the story The very reason for the film to exist in the first place and you will see just how badly this film was pieced together I know year olds that look at this insult to the intelligence and just laugh at it The story is horrible The acting is comical and the message its trying to show is incomprehensible And whats worse is that the cable Movie channels KEEP SHOWING IT Its on twice a day every two or three days Why does anyone in their right mind think that people would want to see this painful piece of celluloid multiple times much less to see it at all My recomendation is dont even bother spending the energy to watch this thing Its just not worth it
0	The performances of Fishbourne who appears strangely funny somehow and short featured Ed Harris are remarkable unlike Connery s who doesn t appear to find sense in his role and ends up in the motorial behaviour of a yr old man In fact the screenplay doesn t make sense imagine a min happy ending plot plus a sudden turn appendix without any argumental structure in respect to the characters It s more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screen wrights schools The more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets The capital punishment is not an issue here although it is a subject from the beginning it sort of fades away without further comment The subject matter and environment could have been good
1	The Classic War of the Worlds by Timothy Hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate H G Wells classic book Mr Hines succeeds in doing so I and those who watched his film with me appreciated the fact that it was not the standard predictable Hollywood fare that comes out every year e g the Spielberg version with Tom Cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book Obviously everyone looks for different things in a movie Those who envision themselves as amateur critics look only to criticize everything they can Others rate a movie on more important bases like being entertained which is why most people never agree with the critics We enjoyed the effort Mr Hines put into being faithful to H G Wells classic novel and we found it to be very entertaining This made it easy to overlook what the critics perceive to be its shortcomings
1	My son was years old when he saw this movie he is now on a Russian Fishing vessel and said that the movie he was most impressed with and that has lingered in his mind all of these years is the movie of The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle He has asked if it were possible for me to get this for him I am sure that a lot of things go through his head as he has only hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for months and will have more months before his contract expires Since we have Indian blood he connects to this movie On January th he will turn years old and I would like to be able to obtain this movie for him He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs Can you help me obtain this movie Thanking you in advance Dolly Crout Soto Deerfield Beach FL
1	I ve really enjoyed this adaptation of Emma I have seen it many times and am always looking forward to seeing it again Though it only lasts minutes most of the novel plot and sub plots were developed in a satisfactory way All the characters are well portrayed Most of the dialogues come directly from the novel with no silly jokes added as in Emma Thompson s Sense and Sensibility As a foreigner I particularly appreciate the perfect diction of the actors The setting and costumes were beautiful I find this version quite on a par with the miniseries Pride and Prejudice but then the producer and screenwriter were the same Kate Beckinsale did a really good job portraying Emma of whom Jane Austen said she would create a heroin no one but her would love She is snobbish but has just enough youth and inexperience to be still likable Mark Strong was also very good at portraying Mr Knightley not an easy part I think though he has not the charisma shown by Colin Firth s Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice Even the end scene the harvest festival which does not happen in the novel provides a fitting end except for when it shows Emma being cold and almost unpleasant with Frank Churchill whereas in the novel she was thoroughly reconciled with him even telling him that she would have enjoyed the duplicity had she been in his situation A strange departure from the faithfulness otherwise shown throughout the film I find the costumes more beautiful and elaborate than in other adaptations from Jane Austen s novels
1	This movie awed me so much that I watch it at least once a year At times I find it uncomfortable At times I find it empowering And I always find the characters human and real It is a movie that shows you the gritty reality of life in LA starting with the recurring helicopter search lights scanning for the dangers lurking so close to the ordinary lives being carried on by the characters It is also a movie that shows you how the kindness of a stranger can change your life and empower you to make a difference Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you take whether intended or not has powerful repercussions I found this movie to be similar in many ways to Robert Altman s film Short Cuts Both had a star studded roster of perfectly cast actors actresses and both movies allowed you to gradually see how the the characters interrelated with one another and affected each other for better or worse Grand Canyon did a better job of providing a cohesive message hope in the face of despairing reality than Altman s film although I found them both intriguing in their own way This film is a definite must see
1	What I love about this show is that it follows the lives of modern witches and it s a blast to experience their everyday love humor and adventure The literature of magic is so diverse portraying the ideas of classical medieval and modern wizardry like Harry Potter and Sabrina With Sabrina the Teenage Witch this show is so fun and unique because it lets us experience a lot of that modern wizardry seven seasons worth This show has so many great qualities and it s a joy to watch Sabrina live her daily life in the mortal and other realm I would recommend this to any family because the television series is clean funny and adventurous Classic
0	What a shame that a really competent director like Andre de Toth who specialized in slippery shifting alliances didn t get hold of this concept first He could have helped bring out the real potential especially with the interesting character played by William Bishop As the movie stands it s pretty much of a mess as asserted by reviewer Chipe The main problems are with the direction cheap budget and poor script The strength lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept characters pulled in different directions by conflicting forces What was needed was someone with vision enough to pull together the positive elements by reworking the script into some kind of coherent whole instead of the sprawling awkward mess that it is try to figure out the motivations and interplay if you can Also a bigger budget could have matched up contrasting location and studio shots and gotten the locations out of the all too obvious LA outskirts The real shame lies in a waste of an excellent cast Hayden Taylor before his teeth were capped Dehner Reeves along with James Millican and William Bishop shortly before their untimely deaths Few films illustrate the importance of an auteur with vision more than this lowly obscure Western which in the right hands could have been so much more
1	Aside from a few titles and the new Sherlock Holmes movie I think I ve watched every movie Guy Ritchie has directed Twice Needless to say I m a big fan and Revolver is one of the highlighted reasons why This movie is a very different approach from Ritchie when you look at it comparatively with Lock Stock and Snatch Revolver sets us up for a psychological thriller of sorts as a gambling con finds himself at the mercy of a set of foes he didn t expect and a guided walk for redemption that he didn t know he needed Along with seeing Andr Benjamin of OutKast fame strut his acting ability other standout acts are Ray Liotta playing the maniacal Mr D Macha and Mark Strong playing Sorter the hit man After being sent to prison by a tyrannous casino owner Macha Jake uses his time in solitary to finesse a plot to humiliate Macha and force his hand in compensating him for the seven years he spent When he wins a card game and amasses a decent sum from Macha Jake finds himself on the brink of death as he collapses and is diagnosed with an incurable disease that s left him with three days to live A team of loan sharks however have an answer for him and a ticket to life only if he gives them all the money he has and relents to working for them all in a ploy to both take Macha down and show Jake how dangerous he has made himself to himself Along with having the air of death loom and a pair of loan sharks having a field day with his money Jake also has to deal with having a hit put out on him which introduces Sorter a hit man under Macha s employ The depth with the story comes when Jake realizes that some co convicts he spent time with in solitary may very well be the loan shark team out to take him for all he has by crafting all of the unfortunate events that Jake seems to find his way into When faced with this reality though Zack Vincent Pastore and Avi show Jake just how twisted he has become from being in solitary having only the company of his mind and his ego then makes it so that their actual existence is elusive even to Jake The movie unravels to a humbling process for both Jake and Macha as they both come to grips with their inner demons The style of the movie is top notch as you get the gritty feel of the crime world represented and the characters it includes Although a lot of nods at Ritchie s previous films are here it still has a presence of its own from the dialogue the sets and the experimental take on the gangster genre It s also a great trip on humility and recognizing when you can easily let your ego or a preset notion mask you ability to accomplish what you want or overcome what you should The characters are well crafted in this movie with all sides being fleshed out and true to Ritchie fashion they re all tied in by some underhandedness that throws a wrench in everyone s affairs I could and would like to go on about this film and its unique nuances but I don t want to take too much away from it if you haven t seen it yet It may take a few sittings to get through all the intricate layers but it s a great movie and it should be seen If you re lucky and you haven t seen the watered down US release see if you can get the original UK version as it will make for a great discussion piece among friends as you try to puzzle in your take I saw it with my crew around early and we re still talking about it with little things we ve picked up on today It has garnered its cult status and it s well deserved as the film where Ritchie stepped out the box and broke his norm a bit Standout Line Fear or revere me but please think I m special We share an addiction We re approval junkies
0	OK Hollywood is not liberal Obviously I m lieing because it is Im a conservative but the politics i will leave out of my opinion of the movie This movie was anti bush anti middle east anti big oil propaganda but that is not why it was bad Fist off i will give credit where credit is due i saw this film opening night because i happen to like these kinds of films and am a political science major in collage The cinematography was excellent and the acting was as far as i could tell very good The plot was impossible for me to decode however I have been tested and have an IQ of but no matter how hard i tried there was no way i could piece together the story line of the movie and what characters where doing what The story and scene sequence was totally incoherent and poorly organized Unless this is one of those movies that is meant to be watch many times to get the full depth pf the story which it very well may be i have no idea exactly what was going on Which makes sense because if you want to make a political argument and not receive any criticism then make your argument impossible to critique If you cant dazzle them with brilliance then baffle them with Bull S
1	I absolutely LOVED this movie when I was a kid I cried every time I watched it It wasn t weird to me I totally identified with the characters I would love to see it again and hope I wont be disappointed Pufnstuf rocks I was really drawn in to the fantasy world And to me the movie was loooong I wonder if I ever saw the series and have confused them The acting I thought was strong I loved Jack Wilde He was so dreamy to an year old when I first saw the movie not in I can still remember the characters vividly The flute was totally believable and I can still feel the evil woods Witchy poo was scary I wouldn t want to cross her path
1	I enjoyed this film It was funny cute silly and entertaining Had a fine cast and really got hammered by some critics for reasons that I truly don t understand No it wasn t The Grapes of Wrath or Casablanca or even Moonstruck but it was an enjoyable film Julia was excellent playing the psychotic man behind the man The story is a little silly to be sure but it this isn t high drama folks I happened to see a review of the film probably the only good one it got and then ran into it one night when looking for a movie I never heard it was supposed to stink until after I saw it and I m glad I saw it Eventually bought the VHS tape on the bargain pile and I watch it a couple times a year
1	The van trotta movie rosenstrasse is the best movie i have seen in years i am actually not really interested in films with historical background but with this she won my interest for that time the only annoying thing about the movie have been the scenes in new york and the impression i had of trying to be as American as possible which i think has absolutely failed the scenes in the back really got to my heart the German actress katja riemann completely deserved her award she is one of the most impressing actress i have ever seen in future i will watch more of her movies great luck for me that i am a native German speaking and only for a year in the us so as soon as i am back i ll buy some riemann dvds so to all out there who have not seen this movie yet WATCH IT i think it would be too long to describe what it is all about yet especially all the flash backs and switches of times are hard to explain but simply watcxh it you will be zesty
0	Left Behind is an incredible waste of more than million dollars The acting is weak and uninspiring the story even weaker The audience is asked to believe the totally implausible and many times laughable plot line and given nothing in return for their good faith Not only is the film poorly acted and scripted it is severely lacking in all the technical areas of filmmaking The production design does nothing to help the credibility of the action The effects are wholly unoriginal and flat The lighting and overall continuity are inexcusably awful even compared to movies with a tenth of the budget However none of this will matter in that millions of families will no doubt embrace the film for it s wholesomeness and it s religious leanings and who can blame them However it is unfortunate that they will be forced to accept rd rate amatuer filmmaking
1	Strange yet emotionally disturbing chiller about fed up middle aged man William H Macy who finally decides to leave the family business murder for hire run by his quietly over demanding father Donald Sutherland while seeing a shrink John Ritter and flirting with another patient Neve Campbell Talk about a major dilemma but Panic is a top notch thriller that looks like American Beauty meets The Professional Macy and Sutherland are the stand outs here Remarkable debut for first time writer director Henry Bromell I m surprised that this movie didn t get a chance to stay in theaters for more than a couple of weeks
1	Wonderful romance comedy drama about an Italian widow Cher who s planning to marry a man she s comfortable with Danny Aiello until she falls for his headstrong angry brother Nicholas Cage The script is sharp with plenty of great lines the acting is wonderful the accents I ve been told are letter perfect and the cinematography is beautiful New York has never looked so good on the screen A must see primarily for Cher and Olympia Dukakis they re both fantastic and richly deserved the Oscars they got A beautiful funny film A must see
1	Watching this movie again really brought back some great childhood memories I m now have not seen it since I was I had almost forgotten about this movie but when I watched it again recently some scenes literally brought a tear to my eye That little robot Jinx friends for ever It was just like revisiting my childhood It was an absolutely amazing experience for me I will always cherish this movie for that reason I hope some of you readers can relate to my experience not for this particular movie but any movie you have not seen in a long while Very nostalgic Thanks for reading
1	After erasing my thoughts nearly twenty seven times there is a feeling that I can now conquer this review for the complex French drama Read My Lips Having written over five hundred reviews I have never found myself at such a loss of words as I did with director Jacques Audiard s subtle yet inspirational love story Thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film and while the loves overpowered it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind Read My Lips is a drama To be more precise is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work Here is where this review begins to crumble it is all of these items but it is more much much more As a viewer you are pulled in instantly by Emmanuelle Devos portrayal of this fragile woman named Carla whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty Audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid causing an immediate unrest not only from the characters within the film but to those watching Without sound the world is left open to any possibility and that is frightening As we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet Paul played exquisitely by Vincent Cassel a slicked back hair mustache wearing lanky man who was just released from prison homeless jobless and forced by his parole officer to get a job This is how Carla and Paul meet There is that moment of instant unsettling attraction The one where we think she loves him but he is dark and here is where it gets even more fun and where we think he loves her but she is dark The constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown Who as viewers are we to feel the most sympathy for Paul sleeps in the office Carla helps him Carla looses a contract to a rival co worker Paul helps her Carla s ability to read people s lips comes in handy for a make shift idea for Paul The continual jumps back and forth keep you on your chair waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave It never does Audiard cannot just allow this story to take place he continually introduces us to more characters one just as seedy as the next Even our rock our solid foundation with the parole officer is in question when his wife goes missing a subplot to this film that at first angered me but upon further debate was a staple finale for this film Yet none of this could have happened if it weren t for our characters Devos solemn and homely look is breathtaking as she changes her image for Paul the truth of her beauty is discovered Paul the wildcard in the film continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame Then just as we assume one Carla takes on one last shape Audiard knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters Cassel and Devos could just play cards the entire time and I would still be sitting at the end of my chair The story probably the weakest part of this film is at first random The interwoven stories seem unconnected at first but Audiard lets them connect bit by bit Again the entire parole officer segment was tangent but that final scene just solidified the ends to the means Not attempting to sound vague but this complex yet utterly simple story is difficult to explain There is plenty happening but it is up to you to connect the pieces A favorite scene is when Carla is attempting to discover where some money is being held That use of sound and scene was brilliant It was tense it was dramatic and it was like watching a who dun it mystery unfold before your eyes Overall I initially though this was a mediocre French film that I could easily forget about when it was over I was proved wrong Read My Lips opens the floor for discussion not just with the characters but the situations One will find themselves rooting for Carla in one scene and Paul in the next When a discovery is made in Paul s apartment by Carla I found myself deeply angry Audiard brought true emotion to the screen with his characters and development and what he was lacking in plot the actors were able to carry I can easily suggest this film to anyone but be prepared this isn t a one time viewing film Repeat Repeat Repeat Grade out of
1	really excellent movie one of the best i ve seen Touching and simple just like life sometimes you cry sometimes you laugh and it s just beautiful not too much of anything just as it s suppose to be Really loved the idea of the movie noone is bad or good all or just people sometimes make mistakes mostly because of society s pressure everyone tries to stay strong and some succeed more than others and the most important thing is that you don t have reasons to get angry you can do it but eventually the anger goes away and then you to need to let love come back in although it s hard there lies the true happiness Great actors and cast the movie really gets you into the feeling of the movie nice nice nice I recommend to see it especially if you like to see italians life
0	What to say about this movie Well it is about a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and turn into delinquent students that sell more of the bad drugs to people Two of those people have adverse effects as one turns into a toxic avenger type and his girlfriend throws up some creature that grows in the school s basement That is about all there is to it and they stretch it out for minutes This movie is pretty bad and should be locked away forever Though that is not fair some people like Troma s movies and they can watch it if they want Troma movies for me though are the worst movies there are out there I just watched this one out of morbid curiosity
1	This is an excellent modern day film noir excellent in that it s interesting start to finish There are some holes in here and some goofy parts that make you shake your head in disbelief but I haven t found anyone who didn t get caught up in this story The movie has the right amount of action suspense plot twists and interesting characters In addition it sports some nice colors and cinematography plus a good guitar based soundtrack I labeled this crime movie a film noir because it s gritty and the all the characters are no good Even the only supposed good guy played by Nicholas Cage gets himself in trouble by lying and has a quick affair he should t have He also does something at the end which isn t right but I m not going the spoil it by saying Suffice to say however that the rest of the characters are so bad they make Cage look good Speaking of bad guys does anyone do it better than Dennis Hopper Not many At least in the deranged category he s tough to beat Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to watch for a bunch of reasons J T Walsh gives another great supporting performance too This is one of those films that never got much publicity but it should have You ll have fun watching this By the way try saying the name of this movie out loud three times fast without messing it up
1	Possible spoilers I recently watched this movie with my year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences Ron Ely is just right as Doc Cool calm almost always in control and with an occasional twinkle in his eye What more can one ask for I have never read a Doc Savage book so I don t know if it is faithful to the source but I enjoyed the light tone and derring do Many people have compared this movie to Raiders of the Lost Ark which I don t think is fair The difference in budget is astounding Raiders must have at least times the budget Doc Savage does not have the extensive location work that Raiders has Special effects are also at a minimum but come on people the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right The Sousa music is catchy love that theme song Every time I watch the film I end up humming the theme for days The best way to approach this film is to just RELAX and enjoy Highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and Doc chase the Indian sniper throughout the rooftops of New York and the VERY funny fight sequence between Doc and Captain Seas Not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib really Overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day I give it out of Doc Savage Doc Savage thank the lord he s here
0	This movie isn t about football at all It s about Jesus GOD It s the same kind of sappy sanctimonious religious drivel you get from those arch idiots who wrestle for Jesus or pump iron for Jesus Yeah Jesus was totally buffed liked contact sports and definitely owned a full set of dumb bells DUHHH This movie should have been entitled Hiking for Jesus or something along those lines just to let the general public know that the real intent of this movie is to convert people to Christianity and to pander to those whose brains have already been thoroughly washed in the blood of the lamb That the title is derived from the Bible is made clear when the head coach is reading his Bible and asking Jesus for help The recent sports movie Invincible was times more inspiring than this was and Jesus wasn t even a factor It was just the desire and determination of an individual with a dream Any broad appeal as an inspirational sports movie is ultimately lost amidst all of the blatant Bible thumping and sanctimonious religious propaganda One gets the impression that the sole message is the only way you can succeed and make positive gain is if you accept Jesus as your personal savior But this is simply not true and is therefore a lie being perpetuated by those who believe that it is true and want everyone else to believe it The image of the winning athlete thanking Jesus when he wins comes directly to mind What does he do when he loses Does he curse Jesus Of course not When he loses Jesus isn t responsible Jesus is only responsible when he wins And the logic goes round and round and round and it ends up exactly where the true believer needs it to be every time I had to hit pause when the scene with the coach receiving a brand new truck came on so I could stop rolling on the floor laughing my ass off and catch my breath Materialism is not what Jesus taught I find it odd that most so called Christians seem to either forget or ignore this message from their savior especially when I see a Jesus fish on the back of a huge gas guzzling SUV that passes me like I m standing still Another message this movie implies is that Jesus apparently cares more about the win loss record of a mediocre high school football team that he does about the millions of starving children in the world The final scene where the insecure and unsure kicker boots a yard field goal and it is hyped up as an unbelievably incredible miracle puts the final gag me with a spoon religious red flag on this turkey I only gave it three stars because the guy who played the black coach could actually act
0	This movie is trash poor It has horrible taste and is pedestrian and unconvincing in script although supposedly based on real events which doesn t add much of anything but make it more of a disappointment Direction is not well done at as scenes and dialogue are out of place Not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or story To start Williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship breakup nor is the relationship itself interesting What s worse his character is compelled by an ugly pedophile story that is base and has no place as a plot device You have an older Rory Culkin tastelessly spouting d ck smker in good fun which is annoying enough and then laughed up by the Williams character Finally you have Sandra Oh as a guardian angel adviser to Williams and a thrown in explanation of the whole fiasco towards the end Toni Collete s character is just plain annoying and a re hash of her th Sense performance with poorer direction Very Miss able
0	Since most review s of this film are of screening s seen decade s ago I d like to add a more recent one the film open s with stock footage of B s bombing Germany the film cut s to Oskar Werner s Hauptmann captain Wust character and his aide running for cover while making their way to Hitler s Fuehrer Bunker once inside they are debriefed by bunker staff personnel the film then cut s to one of many conference scene s with Albin Skoda giving a decent impression of Adolf Hitler rallying his officer s to Ultimate Victory while Werner s character is shown as slowly coming to realize the bunker denizen s are caught up in a fantasy world some non bunker event s are depicted most notable being the flooding of the subway system to prevent a Russian advance through them and a minor subplot involving a young member of the Flak unit s and his family s difficulty in surviving this film suffer s from a number of detail inaccuracies that a German film made only year s after WW should not have included the actor portraying Goebbels Willy Krause wear s the same uniform as Hitler including arm eagle Goebbels wore a brown Nazi Party uniform with swastika armband the SS soldier s wear German army camouflage the well documented scene of Hitler awarding the iron cross to boy s of the Hitler Youth is shown as having taken place INSIDE the bunker it was done outside in the courtyard and lastly Hitler s suicide weapon is clearly shown as a Belgian browning model most account s agree it was a Walther PPK some bit s of acting also seem wholly inaccurate with the drunken dance scene near the end of the film being notable this bit is shown as a cabaret skit with a intoxicated wounded soldier his arm in a splint maniacally goose stepping to music while a nurse does a combination striptease belly dance all by candlelight this is actually embarrassing to watch the most incredible bit is when Werner s Captain Wust gain s an audience alone with Skoda s Hitler Hitler is shown as slumped on a wall bench drugged and delirious when Werner s character begin s to question him Hitler start s screaming which bring s in a SS guard who mortally wound s Werner s character in the back with a gunshot this fabricated scene is not based on any true historic account Werner s character is then hauled off to die in a anteroom while Hitler prepare s his own ending Hitler s farewell to his staff is shown but the suicide is off screen the final second s of the movie show Hitler s funeral pyre smoke slowly forming into a ghostly image of the face of the dead Oskar Werner Hauptmann Wust this film is more allegorical than historical and anyone interested in this period would do better to check out more recent film s such as the remake Hitler the last day s or the German film Downfall Der Untergang if they wish a more true accounting of this dramatic story these last two film s are based on first person eyewitness account s with Hitler the last day s being compiled from Gerhard Boldt s autobiography as a staff officer in the Fuehrer Bunker and Downfall being done from Hitler s secretary s recollection s the screen play for Der Letzte Akte is taken from American Nuremberg war crime s trial judge Michael Musmanno s book Ten day s to die which is more a compilation of event s many obviously fanciful than eyewitness history it is surprising that Hugh Trevor Roper s account The last day s of Hitler was never made into a film
1	This is probably one of the most original love stories I have seen for ages especially for a war based briefly film Basically it is a story based in two worlds one obviously real the other fictitious but the filmmakers say at the beginning that it is only coincidence if it is a real place Anyway Peter Carter the great David Niven was going to crash in a plane he talked to June Planet of the Apes Kim Hunter before he bailed out and said he loved her He was meant to die from jumping without a parachute but somehow he survived and now he is seeing and loving June in the flesh This other place like a heaven is unhappy because he survived and was meant to come to their world so they send French Conductor Marius Goring to persuade him to go but he is obviously in love Peter suggests to him that he should appeal to keep his life to the other world s court he is granted this Obviously love prevails when the two lovers announce that they would die for each other June even offers to take his place Also starring Robert Coote as Bob Trubshawe Kathleen Byron as An Angel a brief then unknown Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as An English Pilot and Abraham Sofaer as The Judge The Surgeon David Niven was number on The Greatest British Actors the film was number on The Greatest Tearjerkers for the happy ending it was number on The Greatest War Films it was number on The Greatest British Films and it was number on The Greatest Films Outstanding

0	Some news reporters and their military escorts try to tell the truth about a epidemic of zombies despite the government controlling the media The makings of the film don t understand that the George Romero zombie films only worked because he kept his politics subtly in the background of most of his films Land of the Dead withstanding This satire is about as subtle as a brick to the face or a bullet to the head is more apropos for this scenario What s subversive or subtle about seeing a military guy masturbating to death and destruction Anything nuanced about the various commercials that are inter cut with the film Nope Furthermore the acting is uniformly horrible the characters thoroughly unlikable and the plot inane Add this all up and you have the worst most incompetent zombie film since C H U D reared it s hideous head My Grade D
0	Actually this is a lie Shrek D was actually the first d animated movie I bought it on DVD about years ago Didn t Bug s Life also do that I think it was at Disneyworld in that tree so I m saying before they go and use that as there logo Also Shrek d was a motion simulator at Universal Studios They should still consider it as a movie because it appeared in a theater and you could buy it for DVD The movie was cute at least the little flyes were I liked IQ I agree with animaster they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a out and back adventure I recommend it to families and kids
0	The main problem with the documentary Czech Dream is that isn t really saying what it thinks it s saying In an audacious I hesitate to use the word inspired act of street theater Vit Klusak and Filip Remunda two student filmmakers from the Czech Republic pulled off a major corporate hoax to serve as the basis for their movie they deliberately fabricated a phony hypermarket the Eastern European equivalent of Costco or Wal Mart Super Store built an entire ad campaign around it replete with billboards radio and TV spots an official logo a catchy theme song and photos of fake merchandise and then waited around to see just how many dopes would show up to their creation on opening day They even built a makeshift fa ade to convince people that the store itself actually existed One might well ask Why do such a thing Well that s a very good question but the answer the filmmakers provide isn t all that satisfying a one Essentially we re told that the purpose of the stunt was to show how easily people can be manipulated into believing something even something that s not true simply through the power of advertising And the movie makers run for moral cover by claiming that the real i e higher purpose for the charade is to convince the Czech people not to fall for all the advertisements encouraging them to join the European Union Fair enough especially when one considers that the actual advertisers who agree to go along with the stunt declaim against the unethical nature of lying to customers all the while justifying their collaboration in the deception by claiming it to be a form of research into what does and does not work in advertising In a way by allowing themselves to be caught on camera making these comments these ad men and women are as much dupes of the filmmakers as the poor unsuspecting people who are the primary target of the ruse But in many ways the satirical arrow not only does not hit its intended target it ironically zeroes right back around on the very filmmakers who launched it For it is THEY THEMSELVES and NOT the good hearted and naturally trusting people who ultimately come off as the unethical and classless ones here as they proceed to make fools out of perfectly decent people some of them old and handicapped and forced to travel long distances on foot to get to the spot And what is all this supposed to prove anyway That people are greedy because they go to the opening of a new supermarket looking for bargains Or that they re stupid and gullible because they don t suspect that there might not be an actual market even though one has been advertised Such vigilance would require a level of cynicism that would make it virtually impossible to function in the real world No I m afraid this smart alecky nasty little stunt only proves what complete and utter jerks the filmmakers are for making some really nice people feel like idiots And indeed many of them when they finally discover the trick that s been played on them react with a graciousness and good humor I m not sure I would be able to muster were I to find myself in their position I m not saying that the movie isn t gripping something akin to witnessing a massive traffic accident in action but when the dust has finally settled and all the disappointed customers return red faced and empty handed to their homes we can safely declare that they are not the ones who should be feeling ashamed
0	I love a good war film and I fall into the been there done that category So I would like to think my review is an accurate one IMHO Having just watched this film on DVD I can safely say that it was a pile of rubbish There is no way I can recommend this film to you It started off with me shouting at the TV saying you wouldn t do that etc but I soon realised that having a bit of job experience would be a hindrance so I chilled a bit But on the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell off I got a nasty feeling that this film would be a predictable dud I was right There simply wasn t any logic to the EOD scenes I just know that the army team had some of the most patient insurgents ever at the other end of the command wire or remote trigger So much so I was left scratching my head all the time Then just when you think you know where the story is going the guys in the Humvee are off out on their own driving around the desert One of the most valuable assets in theatre out on a jolly bumping into some SAS wannabe contractors The sniper scene was just so laughable It just made no sense at all and made me want to switch off there and then Then for them to drag it out so long really did test my patience It started with the Contact Right and went down hill fast If you had a Brit accent then you got shot but if you were part of the EOD team then suddenly you were a great shot and saved the day Then just as you thought it was over it stretched on for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story at all You are just left watching and asking why hasn t it ended yet Then we had the booze scene where they just hit each other for a laugh another scene where you just wanted it to end It added nothing to the film Then just as my life seemed very dull the main star went outside the wire to hunt someone down This most be the most ridiculous scene I have ever watched It defied all logic and ability to write a good storyline it was senseless and awful I still don t understand why they wasted time on it Then to watch him just jog through the busy streets heading back to camp had me rolling on the floor with laughter Pure comedy The sad fact is that this storyline is all over the show without really deciding what it wants to be I thought it was going to be stupid illogical EOD scenes but then it kept going off on tangents trying to be something different But as hard as it tried it just bored me to death All I wanted was for it to end It was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed into a batch of stupid senseless action ish scenes There is no way I can recommend this Maybe my work experience compromised the enjoyability but even the naive must realise this just doesn t make sense The only thing more stupid than this film is the artificially high IMDb rating which must be the work of the box office PR team who seem to use this website as a way of making everyone think it is good Sorry folks it just ain t Not recommended it will just bore you
1	Presque Rien Come Undone is an earlier work by the inordinately gifted writer director S bastien Lifshitz with the collaboration of writer St phane Bouquet the team that gave us the later Wild Side As we come to understand Lifshitz s manner of storytelling each of his works becomes more treasureable By allowing his tender and sensitive love stories to unfold in the same random fashion found in the minds of confused and insecure youths time now time passed time reflective time imagined time alone Lifshitz makes his tales more personal involving the viewer with every aspect of the characters responses It takes a bit of work to key into his method but going with his technique draws us deeply into the film Mathieu handsome and gifted J r mie Elka m is visiting the seaside for a holiday a time to allow his mother Dominique Reymond to struggle with her undefined illness cared for by the worldly and wise Annick Marie Matheron and accompanied by his sister Sarah Laetitia Legrix their distant father has remained at home for business reasons Weaving in and out of the first moments of the film are images of Mathieu alone looking depressed riding trains speaking to someone in a little recorder We are left to wonder whether the unfolding action is all memory or contemporary action While sunning at the beach Mathieu notices a handsome youth his age starring at him and we can feel Mathieu s emotions quivering with confusion The youth C dric St phane Rideau follows Mathieu and his sister home continuing the mystery of attraction Soon C dric approaches Mathieu and a gentle introduction leads to a kiss that begins a passionate love obsession Mathieu is terrified of the direction he is taking rebuffs C dric s public approaches but continues to seek him out for consignations The two young men are fully in the throes of being in love and the enactment of the physical aspect of this relationship so very necessary to understanding this story is shared with the audience in some very erotic and sensual scenes Yet as the summer wears on Mathieu a committed student realizes that C dric is a drifter working in a condiment stand at a carnival It becomes apparent that C dric is the Dionysian partner while Mathieu is the Apollonian one in a telling time in architectural ruin Mathieu is excited by the beauty of the history and space while C dric is only interested in the place as a new hideaway for lovemaking Mathieu is a complex person coping with his familial ties strained by critical illness and a non present father a fear of his burgeoning sexuality and his nascent passion for C dric Their moments of joy are disrupted by C dric s admission of infidelity and Mathieu s inability to cope with that issue and eventually they part ways Time passes family changes are made and Mathieu drifts into depression including a suicide attempt The manner in which Mathieu copes with all of these challenges and finds solace strangely enough in one of C dric s past lovers Pierre Nils Ohlund brings the film to an ambiguous yet wholly successful climax After viewing the film the feeling of identification with these characters is so strong that the desire to start the film from the beginning now with the knowledge of the complete story is powerful Lifshitz has given us a film of meditation with passion conflicts with passion s powers found in love and a quiet film of silences and reveries that are incomparably beautiful The entire cast is superb and the direction is gentle and provocative Lifshitz is most assuredly one of the bright lights of film making In French with English subtitles Highly Recommended Grady Harp
0	I thought this movie seemed like a case study in how not to make a movie for the most part Since I am a filmmaker I give it a for consistency The problems remain from beginning to end with the plot being extremely predictable using bits and pieces of most if not all previous successful war stories The computer generated graphics were too much like viewing a video game at points and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add some realistic quality to the story I was interested in the budget to get an idea of what he had to work with but did not find that information It seemed like this project pushed the limits of a low budget movie too far resulting in a production that drags the viewer along with the story without their imagination being engaged The actors weren t bad but the plot needs more innovation

0	This was so far the worst movie I have seen in my entire life and I have seen some REALLY bad movies I saw this movie at my local video store and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie Little did I know that the cover would be the best part of the movie Where to start The filming of the movie was scattered and boring At one point there is a one minute scene of no one talking just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day Nothing happened they just drove in silence The whole movie is boring with annoying unbelievable dialogue and basically no plot to speak of If you rent this movie watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy Otherwise when you see this movie run
1	Although I didn t like Stanley Iris tremendously as a film I did admire the acting Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in this movie I haven t always been a fan of Fonda s work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time De Niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold He gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he can t care for him anymore that will break your heart I wouldn t really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment but I will say you won t see much bette acting anywhere

0	First of all I d like to say that I love the Ladies Man sketch on SNL I always laugh out loud at Tim Meadows portrayal of Leon Phelps However there is a difference between an minute sketch and a feature length movie Watching Leon doing his show and making obscene comments to his listeners and coming up with all sorts of segments for his show like The Ladies Man Presents which is reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock Presents is absolutely hilarious There s a great episode where Cameron Diaz role plays Monica Lewinski and Leon plays Bill and they call it The Oral Office See that s funny In the movie we don t see Leon on the show too often In fact he gets kicked out of almost every radio station in the country And the plot revolves around his quest for true love involving a mystery letter that got dropped off at his houseboat signed by Sweet Thing Karyn Parsons who is famous for playing Hillary on Fresh Prince of Bel Air works with him on the show and has a secret crush on Leon The movie just piles on one boring subplot after another And the gags are boring as well The first time we see Leon mention the word wang it s pretty funny When he uses it over and over again supposedly trying to get a laugh the joke has run dry Most of the jokes he uses in the film are jokes we heard before and done better on the SNL sketch and played out tediously for a whole hour and twenty five minutes They even try to insert a musical number by Will Ferrell and his gang of Ladies Man haters who all want to destroy him because their wives had an affair with him to bring some life into this witless comedy Ferrell has some funny moments and tries to make the best out of an otherwise unfunny role Ferrell just has that unique comic talent and he s funny at almost anything he does Even Julianne Moore gets a cameo Watching her you can t but wonder What the hell is an Oscar winning actress doing in this movie Her name wasn t mentioned in the opening credits probably by her consent And of course a movie of this theme has to include the Master of Love himself Billy Dee Williams Billy Dee is charismatic as always but even he can t breathe enough life into this film I also have to add that the soundtrack is full of soft R B hits which impairs the film even more giving it a horribly downbeat tone as if the script isn t boring enough I mean this is supposed to be a comedy The soundtrack would ve been appropriate for something like Love Jones The Ladies Man only has sporadic laughs There are exceptions in which SNL can produce a great movie out of a short sketch Watch both of the Wayne s World movies and you ll see how it s done But this movie just like adapting Mary Catherine Gallagher s character to screen in Superstar shows the flip side Some sketches are meant to be remembered on SNL and not on the silver screen My score out of
1	Midnight Cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in drawing an X rating By today s standards it would be hard pressed to pull an R rating Jon Voight who has been better is competent in his role as Joe Buck an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in New York City He meets a seedy street hustler named Ratso Rizzo who tries to befriend Buck for his own purposes The two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic As Ratso Dustin Hoffman simply shines Hoffman has often been brilliant but never more so than in this portrayal He is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison Losing the Academy Award to John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Director Schlessinger has a deft hand with his production but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer Worth seeing for Hoffman s performance alone

1	The film Torrent was a first and a last for Greta Garbo It was her first American made film at MGM the only studio in the USA that she would ever work at It was also the last time that someone else was billed above her in the credits that being her leading man her Ricardo Cortez Torrent is based on the popular Spanish writer s Vicente Blasco Ibanez s work Entre Naranjos It concerns a pair of mismatched lovers Garbo and Cortez who can t quite get together mostly due to the machinations of Cortez s mother Marta Mattox Mattox is a wicked woman who has some set ideas about who her son should be marrying Remember this is Spain and such arranged marriages were still even in those times quite proper Mattox has Gertrude Olmstead in mind as a daughter in law she s the offspring of Mack Swain a man grown rich in hog raising Swain provides a few moments of comic relief with his tender concern for the piglets before they grow into big old hogs to be butchered Blasco Ibanez had previous novels The Four Horseman Of The Apocalypse and Blood And Sand previously filmed with Rudolph Valentino in the lead It might have been interesting if Valentino had done this one with Garbo but he might have been beyond film making when this was done In any event one of the Valentino wannabes Ricardo Cortez fills in with the male lead One reason Valentino might not have wanted this film is because clearly the lead character is Garbo s unlike the other two works previously mentioned When she gets done dirt by Cortez who is doing what Mattox and her adviser banker Tully Marshall tell her she leaves Spain and goes to France where she becomes a great opera star And leads quite the scandalous life there When she returns to Spain and tries to rekindle things Mattox is even more outraged She has a political career in mind for her son Cortez is now running for the Spanish Parliament which curiously enough is called the Cortes The title refers to a flood and a dam breaking causing all kinds of havoc in the countryside Cortez in fact braves the Torrent in a row boat trying to rescue Garbo from harm s way When they do get together they have a brutally frank discussion the brutality coming from Garbo The special effects here primitive though they seem now are quite remarkable for their time They look very similar to the shots used in th Century Fox s The Rains Came that came out in and that won an Oscar for Special Effects Unfortunately for Torrent it came out one year before Oscar made his debut I m not going to give any endings away so you ll have to see the film to find out if Cortez and Garbo get together in the end Garbo rightly won rave reviews for her performance and in an age when exaggerated gestures was the norm in silent screen acting she was remarkably subtle in her role So she would be the rest of her career she had a remarkable face for closeups Although Greta Garbo would go on to do far better work than Torrent this film is still a fitting debut for her on the American big screen and holds up very well for today s audience
1	I saw this movie when I was in Israel for the summer my Hebrew is not fluent so the subtitles were very useful I didn t feel lost at any point in the movie You tend to get used to subtitles after about minutes This movie blew me away It depicts two of the most prominent taboos in the middle east today A homosexual relationship between an Israeli and a Palestinian It allows a person to enter both realms of the conflict simultaneously The dilemma the emotions entailed The movie climaxes in tragedy when anger and rage drive one of the lovers to one extremist side an absolute must see
0	Oh dear I was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip off of Japan s Ringu Well I guess the U S made their version of it as well but at least it was an outright remake So so sad I very much enjoy watching Filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country so I can t believe this had to happen Claudine and Kris are such big names there surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism To any aspiring movie makers out there in the Philippines You do not have to stoop this low to make money There are many movie buffs that are watching the movies Filipinos put out and enjoying them
1	The Notorious Bettie Page is about a woman who always wanted to be an actress but instead became one of the most famous pin up girls in the history of America Bettie Page played by Gretchen Mol was one of the first sex icons in America The type of modeling Bettie Page took part in included nudity and bondage which lead to a U S Senate investigation in the s Walking out of the film all I could think about was how far we have come in terms of pornography since the s You can go on the internet now and find some of most disturbing and shocking images ever shot that the footage questioned in The Notorious Bettie Page seems almost childlike and innocent Most of the footage including the bondage did not feature nudity when Bettie Page was involved yet today we have sick images where we can see women having sex with animals I find that maybe the envelope has been pushed a little too far since the s because looking at this movie in terms of today s pornography it was very tastefully done To be honest I was pretty impressed with The Notorious Bettie Page I found the film to be very well done and interesting The movie is exactly what the trailer leads you to believe it will be and is a very interesting look at one of the first female sex icons in America Gretchen Mol looks just like Bettie Page and gives a very fine performance I also thought that since the movie was shot in black and white it made the film seem realistic because it made the audience believe they were watching a film created in the late s My only complaint about the film was the running time there seemed to be a few scenes that were cut and seemed to be a little shorter than they should have been I looked this up and it seems that minutes was cut from the film since its original showing at the Toronto Film Festival Also the ending was pretty tame and I was expecting a little more from it or maybe some paragraphs to come on the screen to tell the audience more about Bettie Page s life where the film left off Those are my only two complaints about the film other than that the directing was solid the acting was great especially Gretchen and the writing was good Mary Harron who directed American Psycho which is one of my favorite films is the director and writer of The Notorious Bettie Page I feel that Mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a setting and create great movies based on characters because like Psycho Bettie Page is a character study and a fine one at that Harron captures the s and s with ease as well as all the characters She is a very talented director who I hope will be around for many years to come Bottom Line The Notorious Bettie Page is definitely worth a look It s a very interesting story that shows how far America as well as the world has come in terms of pornography The film also provides a fine performance by Gretchen Mol who literally nails the role of Bettie Page on the head And top it off with a talented director who was able to capture the look and feel of a previous era and you have a good movie on your hands Sadly this film is probably going to flop since not many besides people who grew up in this era will show interest in the film but I think it s worth checking out MovieManMenzel s final rating for The Notorious Bettie Page is a It s an interesting character study about one of the most famous pin up girls and sex icons in American history
0	This really should have been a one star but there was so many clich s predictable twists seen it all before slasher flick parallels that I actually give it an extra star for the fact it made me laugh although this was never the directors intention Im sure I don t often write comments about films they have to be either sensational or in this ones case really bad To be honest as soon as I saw Jeff Fahey in it I knew it was going to be poor as he has a unique nose for picking out the worst films Somehow the farce of it all made me watch it all the way through possibly for the hilarious voice of MR T not relay Mr T but you ll know what I mean if you bother to watch this if you do watch it make sure you don t pay to see it This may have worked had they actually put intended comedy into it but Im sure you ll find the odd laugh here and there at the farce of it all
0	This film is a massive Yawn proving that Americans haven t got the hang of farce Even when it has already been written for them The original film Hodet Over Vannet is a witty comedy of errors that I would rate It isn t just about a linguistic translation but certain absurd chains of events are skipped entirely robbing the film of its original clever farcical nature and turning it into a cheap oops there go my trousers style of farce
1	Debut Wow Cross Eyed is easily one of the most enjoyable indie films that I ve watched in the past year making it hard to believe that Cross Eyed is the writer s debut film I mean I logged onto IMDb to find more films by this writer because Cross Eyed has that unique signature you want to see what else this writer might have to say These days its rare to see a movie that is well written well directed well edited and well acted For me Cross Eyed encapsulates what movie making should be about combining the best of all film elements to create a clever artistic and poignant tale More please
0	Geez This is one of those movies that you think you previously reviewed but you didn t I mean you didn t give a crap about it but somehow it came to your mind To be honest and brief this is one of the worst boring and stupid slashers ever made I can t say anything good about this piece of crap because there are barely decent sequences that could tell it s made by professional film makers The death scenes are horrible bloodless stupid The plot is somehow good taking in account that it copied Popcorn from To make things even worse this isn t a movie so bad that it s good It s just plain bad Molly Ringwald tried to do her best but it wasn t enough
1	Over the years we ve seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what keeping Simple Rules going after John Ritter died comes to mind but this is probably the first time I cared The idea of having That s Show without Eric or to a lesser extent Kelso is ridiculous They tried to cover it up with a comeback of Leo and increasingly outrageous story lines but it always felt like why bother when you don t have a main character anymore It just didn t really connect it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasn t even funny The last season felt like the season too much for every single character simply because Eric used to take a lot of screen time and now we d be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were Focusing on the gimmick that is Fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working because the whole deal was that he d say something weird from out of nowhere and you can t say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours They also brought in the standard cousin Oliver only this time it just wasn t a kid Whenever you heard somebody knock on the door you started praying it wasn t Randy please let it not be Randy The deal with Randy was that he d do really awful jokes usually as Red would say smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and Donna would be in stitches I think more than half of the last season was Donna pretending to be amused The problems had started earlier though what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasn t about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera Everybody started being in love with everybody emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching As The World Turns I m guessing this was character development but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from Family Matters To be fair the last episode also because it had a cameo by Topher Grace a cameo in his own show was really good even if not that funny either By the way yet more criticism on Season what the hell was with the opening theme Not only did they use the same joke twice a character not singing Fez scared the hell out of me Dude don t open your eyes that far But the first five seasons or so among the best comedy ever broadcast
0	This is not really a zombie film if we re defining zombies as the dead walking around Here the protagonist Armand Louque played by an unbelievably young Dean Jagger gains control of a method to create zombies though in fact his method is to mentally project his thoughts and control other living people s minds turning them into hypnotized slaves This is an interesting concept for a movie and was done much more effectively by Fritz Lang in his series of Dr Mabuse films including Dr Mabuse the Gambler and The Testament of Dr Mabuse Here it is unfortunately subordinated to his quest to regain the love of his former fianc e Claire Duvall played by the Anne Heche look alike with a bad hairdo Dorothy Stone which is really the major theme The movie has an intriguing beginning as Louque is sent on a military archaeological expedition to Cambodia to end the cult of zombies that came from there At some type of compound where we get great s sets and clothes he announces his engagement to Claire and then barely five minutes later she gives him back his ring declaring her love for his pal Clifford Greyson Robert Noland It s unintentionally funny the way they talk to each other without making eye contact This would have been a great movie for Mystery Science Theater if they hadn t already roasted it It s never shown how Louque actually learns the zombification secret but he then uses it to kill his enemies create a giant army of rifle carrying soldiers and body guards We won t see such sheer force of will until John Agar in The Brain From Planet Arous Finally Claire consents to marry him if he will let Greyson live and return to America Louque agrees but actually turns him into one of his hypnotized slaves On their wedding night he realizes that Claire will only begin to love him if he gives up his powers To gain her love he does so causing the revolt of the title in which all his slaves awaken and attack his compound and kill him Greyson embraces Claire and we seem to be at the end of a parable Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad So really then it s not that bad of a film despite the low IMDb rating it currently has On repeated viewings one can see the artistry in the well formed script Dean Jagger had yet to develop into a good actor and is almost unrecognizable in his youngness is that really his own hair We remember him more for his bald old man roles in White Christmas X The Unknown and King Creole The story borrows a lot of its basic themes from the Halperin brothers better earlier film White Zombie in which hapless Robert Frazier as Charles Beaumont uses zombification to win the love of Madge Bellamy as Madeline Parker If you want real zombie movies of which there are hundreds I d start with White Zombie King of the Zombies I Walked with a Zombie Night of the Living Dead The Last Man on Earth and its two remakes In the modern era of classy films there are Horror Express The Serpent and the Rainbow Days Later and its sequel as well as many many others too numerous to mention This one is not really a zombie film Judging this movie on its own terms it s more of a semi Gothic romance As such it ranks a little below some of Universal s bottom billed B horror movies of the late s and early s So I ll give it a
0	If there was some weird inversed Oscar Academy awards festival this flick would win it all It has all the gods excellent plot extreme special effects coupled with extremely good acting skills and of course in every role there is a celebrity superstar Well this could be the scenario if the world was inversed but it s not Instead it s the worst horror flick ever made not only bad actors that seem to read the scripts from a teleprinter with bad dyslexia but also extremely low on special effects For example the devil costume which by the way is a must see is something of the most hilarious I ve ever seen Whenever I saw that red black so called monster on screen I couldn t hold my laugh back And to top of things it looked like the funny creature was transported by a conveyor belt Do not do the same mistake as I did Checking IMDB seeing that the movie was released in had less than five votes and thinking Well it s worth a shot can t be that bad Yes it could I m not even going to waste more words on this movie
0	A wonderful television mini series completely ruined by a year old woman trying desperately to pass herself off as a year old ingenue No exaggeration that s the ACTUAL age of the character played by Ali MacGraw when the film opens just prior to the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor This TV mini series really is the most classic example of the title of this post and one I refer to whenever the topic comes up That alone makes this completely unwatchable despite the fact it s one of the best filmed WWII global dramas TV has ever produced If you have the stomach or a decent fast forward ability you might be able to enjoy the late Robert Mitchum in a very strong performance I m stunned at some of the comments referring to the love story pun intended Did they watch the film with their eyes closed Or are they aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their selective memories and selective vision I m a Boomer myself so don t think for a second I m some hubristic young punk WILL ALWAYS LOOK Get used to it Deal with it Age gracefully damnit The Winds Of War could have been so good How much more would we be talking about this mini series today some years later had an ACTUAL ingenue been cast in such an important critical role Right now with the constant haggard old biddy distraction that alone cancels out most of the wonderful aspects of The Winds Of War
1	Kurosawa is a proved humanitarian This movie is totally about people living in poverty You will see nothing but angry in this movie It makes you feel bad but still worth All those who s too comfortable with materialization should spend hours with this movie
1	I think that this movie is very neat You eithier like Michael Jackson or you don t but if you like him then you have to see this movie I think that it is a very neat film with great song play and good imagination Not to mention the film center piece Smooth Criminal which has some of the best dancing you will every see
0	Many things become clear when watching this film the acting is terrible Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so so but the parent child conflict borders soap opera ish The other two boys an overly pouty child prodigy and your stereotypical I m a babe but I m really sensitive inside blonde dreamboat the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing Robbie s dreams and episodes are disturbing acted by Tom Hanks the inclusion of the beginning love ballads is an odd choice we are all special friends the weird lines and side plots are not made any better by the terrible acting and this is a really bad movie Expect to be disappointed and probably disturbed

1	In celebration of Earth Day Disney has released the film Earth Stopping far short of any strident message of gloom and doom we are treated to some excellent footage of animals in their habitats without feeling too bad about ourselves The stars of the show are a herd of elephants a family of polar bears and a whale and its calf The narrative begins at the North Pole and proceeds south until we reach the tropics all the while being introduced to denizens of the various climatic zones traversed Global warming is mentioned in while we view the wanderings of polar bear note is made of the shrinking sea ice islands in more recent years We never see the bears catch any seals but the father s desperate search for food leads him to a dangerous solution The aerial shots of caribou migrating across the tundra is one of the most spectacular wildlife shots I ever saw it and another of migrating wildfowl are enough to reward the price of admission to see them on the big screen One of the disappointments I felt was that otherwise terrific shots of great white sharks taking seals were filmed in slow motion Never do you get the sense of one characteristic of wild animals their incredible speed The idea of slowing down the film to convey great quickness I think began with or at least it s the first I recall seeing the television show Kung Fu during the early Seventies An interesting sidelight is that as the credits roll during the end some demonstrations of the cinematographic techniques employed are revealed There are enough dramatic humorous and instructive moments in this movie to make it a solid choice for nature buffs Perhaps because of some selective editing sparing us as it were from the grisly end of a prey predator moment and the fact that this footage had been released in and is available on DVD it is a solid film in its own right And you can take your kids Three stars
0	minutes in the beautiful Christina Galbo tries to escape the isolated boarding school she s brought to at the beginning of the movie Is she running from some kind of fate too horrible to contemplate a monster black gloved killer or supernatural evil No she s running from a bunch of bullies For the OTHER minutes that follow various figures walk around the school in the dark holding candelabras and looking alarmed or distraught which doesn t say much in itself perhaps because great movies have been made about just that but if you re going to have characters walking around corridors and staircases you better be Alain Resnais or you better know how to light that staircase in bright apple reds and purples like Mario Bava We know a killer stalks the perimeters of the school but his body count is pitiful and sparse and in the absence of the visceral horrors one expects to find in the giallo we get no sense of sinister mysteries unspeakable secrets festering behind a facade of order and piety and rightness which is the kind of movie La Residencia wants to be but doesn t quite know how to do it We know something is off because girls are reported missing but we never get the foreboding mysterious atmosphere that says something is seriously f cking wrong here man When Serrador tries to comment on the sexual repression of the female students he does so with quick cutting hysterics and detail closeups of eyes and parted lips while high pitched this is shocking music blares in the background None of the aetherial beauty and longing of PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK to be found here It s all a bit clumsy and aimless with no real sense of urgency or direction A number of people are presented as suspects but there s little reason to care for the identity of a killer that goes unnoticed by the characters inside the movie I like the first kill the image of a knife hitting target superimposed over the anguished face of the victim as a lullaby chimes in the background but the rest is too inconsequential for my taste I have to say Serrador did much better with the killing children and paranoia du soleil of WHO CAN KILL A CHILD
1	Okay note to the people that put together these horror acting legends DVD collections I truly am grateful and I hugely support the initiative but have you even watched the films before selecting them as part of the collection When I purchased the Boris Karloff collection there were several films in which the star only played a supportive and unessential role Tower of London The Strange Door The Invisible Ray however is part of the Bela Lugosi collection and here it s actually Boris Karloff who overshadows Bela This actually would have been a great title for the Boris Karloff collection instead Bela Lugosi s character is quite possibly the most good natured and earnest one he ever portrayed in his entire career and good old Karloff actually plays the mad and dangerously obsessed scientist here The Invisible Ray features three main chapters The first one set in Dr Janos Rukh s Carpathian castle is pretty boring and demands quite a lot of the viewer s patience but of course the character drawings and the subject matter discussed here are fundamental for the rest of the film Dr Rukh Karloff demonstrates to a couple of eminent colleagues among them Bela Lugosi as Dr Benet how he managed to capture extraterrestrial rays inside a self manufactured device The scientists are sincerely impressed with his work and invite Rukh and his lovely wife Diane along for an expedition in the heart of Africa There Dr Rukh isolates himself from the group discovers the essential element Radium X to complete his medical ray and goes completely bonkers after being overexposed to the meteorite himself The third and final act is obviously the best and most horrific one as it revolves on a good old fashioned killing spree with ingenious gimmicks melting statues and a surprising climax Karloff glows in the dark and convinced the others are out to steal his discovery and even his life he intends to eliminate them using his deadly touch The narrative structure of The Invisible Ray sounds rather complicated but the film is easy to follow and entertaining The story is rather far fetched but nevertheless compelling and director Lambert Hillyer provides several moments of sheer suspense Boris Karloff is truly fantastic and so is Lugosi even though he deserved to have a little more screen time Their scenes together are the highlights of the film along with the funky images of the glowing Boris
1	Of all the reviews I ve read most people have been exceedingly hard on Alexandre Neither Marie or Veronika ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep Alexandre he being only slightly intelligent though not at all intellectual as most of us are however hard it may be for anyone to admit Alexandre is getting away with life perfectly being totally taken care of getting and giving what he wants the girls are allowing this veronika loves sex marie is his patron is there anything wrong with any of this is anyone in love really i don t think so Though French New Wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion Ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in Alexandre s position in an urban area can ask for I m looking for a patron anyone interested
0	This movie makes me think the others I ve seen with Combs were an accident The plot had more holes than I think I ve ever seen in a movie purporting to be something more than a b movie The acting was so laughable that not even the memories of Combs past campy triumphs were enough to save it Considering the script I have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas I am thoroughly upset that I paid Blockbuster prices for this trash The fact that it was made for television was something that would have helped me avoid this atrocity and frankly something that movies this poor should be required to warn you of Avoid this movie no matter what
1	I could not agree more with the quote this is one of the best films ever made If you think Vanilla Sky is simply a re make you could not be more wrong There is tremendous depth in this film visually musically and emotionally Visually because the film is soft and delicate at times early scenes with Sofia and at other times powerful and intense Times Square post climactic scenes The music and sounds tie into this movie so perfectly Without the music the story is only half told Nancy Wilson created an emotional yet eclectic score for the film which could not be more suitable for such a dream like theme although never released I was able to get my hands on the original score for about If you look hard you may be able to find a copy yourself Crowe s other musical selections such as The Beach Boys Josh Rouse Spiritualized Sigur Ros the Monkees etcetera etcetera are also perfect fits for the film Crowe has an ear for great music More importantly the emotional themes in this film i e love sadness regret are very powerful and are amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience as well as the ingenious dialogue I admit the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes time and time again The best part of this film however as if it could get any better is that it is so intelligently crafted such that each time you see the film you will catch something new so watch closely and be prepared to think Sure a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch but there is always more to the story than you think This is easily Cameron Crowe s best work and altogether a work of brilliance Much of my film making and musical inspiration comes from this work alone It has honestly touched my life as true art has a tendency of doing It continually surprises me that there are many people that cannot appreciate this film for what it is I guess to understand true art is an art itself Bottom line Vanilla Sky is in a league of its own
0	One of a multitude of slashers that appeared in the early eighties Pranks is notable only for an early performance by Daphne Zuniga The Sure Thing The Fly her character dies fairly early on and the rest of the film is totally forgettable During their Christmas break a group of students volunteer to clear a condemned college building of its furniture A crazy killer however throws a spanner in the works by methodically bumping off the youngsters one by one in a variety of gruesome ways Exploiting every stalk n slash clich in the book director Jeffrey Obrow delivers a tedious and unexciting horror that had me praying for the characters to be killed so that I could get on with watching something more worthwhile The majority of the deaths which let s face it is why we generally watch this kind of film are brief and not that gory the only truly grisly imagery comes right at the end when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the remaining survivor there is one notably bloody dismembered corpse the film could ve done with more At the last minute the film saves itself from the disgrace of receiving the lowest possible score from me by having a nice unexpectedly downbeat ending but this really is one for slasher completists only
1	I can understand those who dislike this movie cause of a lack of knowledge First of all those girls are not Geisha but brothel tenants and one that don t know the difference will not understand half of the movie and certainly not the end This is a complete art work about the women s life and needs in this era Everything is important and certainly the way they dress all over the movie means more than words To those who thought it was a boring geisha movie I ll suggest you to read a bit about this society before making a conclusion that is so out of the reality This is Kurosawa s work of is life and I m sure that the director understood the silent meaning of Kurosawa s piece to the right intellectual range
1	This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen The Footage is extraordinary mesmerizing at times It also received an Oscar for best photography and deservedly so I have many movies in my film collection and several more I ve seen besides them and not many of them are more beautifully or even equally as beautifully shot as this one It s unique and an overall great movie The cast is terrific and do a great job in portraying their characters We follow their destinies with devotion and get very emotionally attached to them Along the way we also learn things about ourselves and our lives I think much of this film for what it represent and how it present it I warmly recommend it
0	I ve tried to watch this show several times but for a show called That s Show I don t find much apart from a few haircuts and the occasional reference to disco that actually evokes the s the decade in which I grew up Of the episodes I have seen most of the plots and jokes could be set in any time period Take away the novelty of supposedly being set in the s and the show is neither interesting nor funny If you re looking for a show that more successfully represents the experience of youth in America in the s in my humble opinion you can do no better than The Wonder Years
0	I remember back when I was little when I was away at camp and we would campout under the stars There was always someone there that would have a good story to tell that involved the woods that surrounded us and they would always creep me out Well when I found Wendigo at the library I checked it out hoping to be one of those films that had a supernatural being haunting people in the woods much like the stories that were told at camp Well much to my dismay I was so far from the truth Wendigo is really bad The story starts of when a family of three is driving to their winter cabin which looks like your normal suburban home and nothing like a cabin in the woods and they run into a deer Well it seems the local rednecks were actually hunting this particular deer and are pretty upset at our city folk The movie spends far too much time following the families everyday activities instead of getting to the point of the film It wasn t until about the last minutes that we actually have some action involving the wendigo My suggestion is that you stay very far away this film It will leave you wanting your hour and a half back
1	First and foremost speaking as no fan of the genre The Bourne Ultimatum is a breathtaking virtuoso superb action movie Secondly it is a silly malarky of cartoonish super hero stuff Thirdly the film carries a complex important point about crime fighters turning into criminals themselves No reference is made to Abu Ghraib or the Executive Branch s outrageous domestic assaults on constitutional rights none is necessary So the latest in the Bourne series in the hands of Paul Greengrass of the Bourne Supremacy and last year s United is a significant achievement perhaps held back but not actually diminished by the unavoidable excesses of the genre Breathtaking above is meant both as a complimentary adjective and a description of the physical sensation for more than an hour from the first frame the viewer seemingly holds his breath pushed back against the chair by the force of relentless globe trotting utterly suspenseful action There is no letup no variation in the rhythm and pull of the film and yet it never becomes monotonous and tiresome the way some kindred music videos do after just a couple of minutes Oliver Wood s in your face cinematography is making the best of Tony Gilroy s screenplay from Robert Ludlum s novel which doesn t stack up well against the Bourne Identity written a decade earlier Matt Damon is once again the inevitable irreplaceable Bourne the deadliest of fantasy CIA agents this time taking on the entire agency in search of his identity his past and the mysterious agency program that has turned him into a killing machine Nothing like his quietly heroic Edward R Murrow the always marvelous David Strathairn is the nasty top agency official pitched against Bourne in trying to hide some illegal take no prisoners policies and brutal procedures Joan Allen plays what appears to be the Good Cop against Strathairn s Bad One And there is Julia Stiles as the agent once again coming to Bourne s aid a combination of Greengrass direction and Stiles acting results in a surprising impact by a mostly silent character her lack of communication and blank expression more intriguing than miles of dialogue So good is The Bourne Ultimatum that it gets away with the old one man against the world bit this time stretched to ridiculous excesses as Bourne defies constraints of geography time gravity and physics in general Can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building Why not it looks great All this real world magic leaping from country to country in seconds to arrive at some unknown location exactly as when and how needed outdoes special effect and superhero cartoon improbabilities And yet only a clueless pedant would allow facts interfere with the entertainment based ecstasy of the Bourne fantasy
0	Just a stilted rip off of the infinitely better Murder She Wrote it is absolutely amazing that this poorly written garbage lasted for a full eight years I m sure most of the people who watched this unentertaining crap were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do or simply remembered its star from the old Dick Van Dyke Show Van Dyke who only had a decent career in the s never was much of an actor at all by his own admission and he was already far too old to play a doctor when the series began in He looks absolutely ancient as a result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking His talentless real life son Barry a wooden actor who has rarely been in anything that didn t involve his father plays his son in the series

0	My girlfriend and I were stunned by how bad this film was After minutes we would have called it quits except we were too curious to see if the film could possibly redeem itself It didn t I can t understand the praise given to this film The writing was downright awful and delivered by some of the worst acting I have seen in a very long time One thing that especially annoyed me about this film was that often when people were talking to each other there was an unnatural pause between lines I understand using a pause to create a feeling of awkwardness like in Happiness This was not that type of pause it was just simply bad directing This film might actually be much better with subtitles and maybe the overseas market is the best one for this film because then the innane dialogue and bad acting wouldn t be noticed as much I generally like these types of small quirky films The Real Blonde Walking and Talking Lovely and Amazing but this one failed on so many levels that I consider it one of the very worst films I have sat through in the last few years
0	I have seen many many films from China and Hong Kong This is the worst No the worst one was Unknown Pleasures I watched Platform yesterday evening and thought that Jia Zhang Ke s other two films must be better This evening I was disappointed again I will not be watching Xiao Wu tomorrow evening because I have just placed all three films in the bin Whoever gave this film Platform ten out of ten needs to watch more cinema The photography was very poor it was very difficult to differentiate between some of the characters because of the lack of close up work The storyline was so disjointed that I fast forwarded it towards the end out of pure frustration I would not recommend this film to anyone Give me Zhang Yimou or Chen Kage any day These are true masters of Chinese cinema not pretentious con men
0	Sundown featuring the weakest dorkiest vampires ever seen accompanied by one of the most unfitting pretentious scores ever written and with Shane the vampire who s every move and spoken word was so ridiculous that I burst out laughing half the times and rolled my eyes the rest The vampires don t seem to have any special powers at all except for strength sometimes being able to switch off a lamp with their mind one time and that s it really Ever imagine count Dracula worriedly recoiling from a fight cause he ran out of bullets Neither did I Practically any other movie Dracula would eat this one for breakfast skin his followers and use their bones as toothpicks The main plot of the movie is that a human family of four gets caught up in a vampire gang fight Dracula s vs some old geezer s It could have been some good old B flick fun but the overly dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took this movie a bit too seriously and ends up ruining the remaining part of the movie not already ruined by clay bats mediocre acting and the laughable screenplay In the end it s just too silly to be funny Sure it has some amusing moments but they re few and far apart
1	I love Korean films because they have the ability to really quiet eerily really capture real life I tend to watch Korean movies just for that reason alone I ve seen this directors other movies before The one that comes closest to the feelings I got from this is Oasis and another awesome film called This Charming Girl However my title summary is supposed to be from a Chrstian perspective so I ll just start doing that instead of just showering it with praise For a non Christian perspective Director Chang dong Lee has captured an unbiased and almost eerily real portrayal of a modern Protestant church regardless of denomination warts and all I ve always been waiting for a Christian film that truly portrays the darker recesses of church life Because Christian films tend to speak in a language that is different to those they want to share their faith to Many films with religious undertones though having good motives tend to just have the resonance of a Disney film or after school special They need to show life as it is Real people curse real people lust real people fall And though Christians believe that salvation is available to those that seek it we are still challenged by the everyday horrors of this life And Do yeon Jeon s character is a totally honest and almost brutal portrayal of a woman that found God but because of life s bitter realities loses that love for Him she once had She doesn t deny God exists It is just that she refuses to accept to live with the idea that He is an all loving and forgiving God In her decent to the edges of morality and madness her character asks questions that are in the mind of every one religious or not If God is Love why does He allow such terrible things to happen This film doesn t answer that rightly so And I believe the last minutes of the film though open to interpretation leaves us with a hopeful future for our main character and brings the idea of secret sunshine full circle I don t believe for a second that this film tried to be religious or had in any way tried and set out to be that There in lies the reason why it worked even more It s real it s honest And because of that it is by far the best summation of a real Christian life I have seen on film
1	Secret Sunshine reminded me of The Rapture with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny but this Korean production is a better film It portrays super religious Korean Christians in a provincial Korean city and the main character s experiences interacting with them in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy Shin ae is a widowed single mother who moves to the city of Milyang Secret Sunshine in Chinese from Seoul with her young son She has chosen Milyang because her late husband killed in an auto accident was born there and she feels she needs to make a new start in life in a new place She does not react well to the overtures of the local Christian zealots one of whose members tries to convince her to come to their church and prayer meetings Shin ae is essentially irreligious and brushes these people off as politely as she can In fact she brushes just about everyone in Milyang off to begin with but some of them are persistent in trying to invade her world and the consequences are often hilarious To say more would be to give the film away but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role Jeon Do yeon is stupendous Having read that she won the Best Actress award at Cannes in I expected her to a decent job But Ms Jeon is captivating and it is impossible to take your eyes off her when she is on screen The movie is a sort of harrowing Evelyn Waugh esquire piece of work showing how Fate can feel insane as much as strangely inevitable
1	The Sopranos is perhaps the most mind opening series you could possibly ever want to watch It s smart it s quirky it s funny and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can t resist watching The best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters set in the subterranean world of the New York crime families For most of the time you really don t know whether the wise guys will stab someone in the back or buy them lunch Further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities These are dangerous men most of them murderers but by God if you don t love them too I ve laughed at their wisecracks been torn when they ve made err in judgement and felt scared at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal The suburban setting of New Jersey is absolutely perfect for this show s subtext people aren t always as they seem and the stark contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals weigh up to even the odds If you haven t already you most definitely should
0	I like Goldie Hawn and wanted another one of her films so when I saw Protocol for at Walmart I purchased it Although mildly amusing the film never really hits it a stride Some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purpose Then of course there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as I m concerned I don t think this scene added to the movie at all I don t like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson written by some s burn out especially In the end although I m glad to possess another Hawn movie I m not sure it was really worth the money I paid for it
1	Roman Polanski masterfully directs this sort of a variation on the same theme as Repulsion I can t imagine there is one honest movie goer not able to acknowledge the fine director in Le Locataire yet both parts of the dyptic may not be thoroughly satisfactory to most people myself included Polanski is very good at making us feels the inner torture of his characters Deneuve in Repulsion and himself in Le Locataire starting with some lack of self assurance soon to turn gradually into psychological uneasiness eventually blossoming into an irreversible physical malaise The shared ordeal for the characters and audience is really dissimilar from the fright and tension of horror movies since there s no tangible supernatural element here While horror movies allow for some kind of catharsis be it cheap or more elaborate Polanski sadistically tortures us and if in his latter opus the dark humour is permanent we are mostly on our nerves as opposed to on the edge of our seats Suspense horror all this is a matter of playing with the audience s expectations alternatively fooling and fulfilling them not literally with people s nerves In my book Rosemary s Baby is a far greater achievement because sheer paranoia and plain rationality are in constant struggle the story is about a couple moving in a strange flat while we are forced to identify with a sole character What s more if the fantasy elements are all in the hero s mind the situation is most uncomfortable since we the viewers are compelled to judge him reject him while we have been masterfully lured paint n lure into being him
1	This film is NOT about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment Its about a cat that has used up of its lives and now lives in fear of loosing its last one The cat is jumpy and scared to death all of the time hence the name fraidy cat Fraidy Cat s previous lives haunt him as ghosts which are from different era s in time and are constantly trying to kill him off but he is most fearful of the ninth life which is represented as a cloud in the shape of a number and spits out lighting bolts very old now but would still be fun for the kids if you got hold of a copy i watched this movie almost every day as a child o
1	I m always surprised about how many times you ll see something about World War on the German national television You would think they don t like to open old wounds but there isn t a week that goes by without a documentary or a movie about the horror and atrocities of this war Perhaps it s a way of dealing with their past I don t know but you sure can t blame them of ignoring what happened And it has to be said most of those documentaries are really worth a watch because they never try to gloss over the truth and the same can be said about their movies think for instance about Der Untergang or The Downfall as you might now it which are also very realistic One of those movies is Rosenstrasse It tells a true story and deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the war even though the movie starts with a family in the USA at the present day After Hannah s father died her mother all a sudden turned into an orthodox Jew even though she hasn t been very religious before She doesn t know where the strange behavior of her mother comes from but as she starts digging in her mother s troubled childhood Hannah understands how little she has ever known about her mother s past The fact that this movie deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the Nazi regime is already quite surprising For as far as I know there hasn t been another movie that deals with this subject For those who didn t know this yet Being married to a so called pure Aryian man or woman meant for many Jews that they weren t immediately sent to one of the concentration camps but that they had to work in a factory But it does not only tell something about the problems of the mixed marriages it also gives a good idea of how these people were often seen by their own parents and relatives How difficult it sometimes was for them during the Nazi regime and how these people most of the time women did everything within their power to free their men once they were captured and locked away in for instance the Rosenstrasse The acting is really good and the story is very well written although the way it was presented in the beginning didn t really do it for me and that s exactly the only part that you ll get to see in the trailer Perhaps it s just me but I would have left out a big part of what happens in the present day At least of the part that is situated in the USA because the part where Hannah goes to Berlin and talks to someone who knows more about her mother s past definitely works If you are interested in everything that has something to do with the Second World War and if you aren t necessarily looking for a lot of action shots than this is definitely a movie you should see This isn t a movie in which you ll see any battles or gunfights but it certainly is an interesting movie because it gives you an idea about an aspect of the war only little is known of I give it an
0	Here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea That is the problem isn t The concept is fresh and full of potential but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance It should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions get you interested and invested in the characters This movie doesn t have what it takes to take off and sustain flight and here is why First you don t really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here it s suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation They are not believable in the way they act and interact Example Jeffrey Combs as a cop over chewing is gum frowning and looking intense all the time isn t the way to go here I mean what is that he looks like he s on the toilet or something I loved him in re animator and the way he was playing the intense neurotic unappreciated medical genius was right on the money But not for this he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner it s not natural I m surprised he didn t dislocate his jaw during filming The movie is basically on life support it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come
1	This miracle of a movie is one of those films that has a lasting long term effect on you I ve read a review or two from angry people who I guess are either republicans or child beaters and their extremist remarks speak of the films power to confront people with their own darkest secrets No such piece of art has ever combined laughter and tears in me before and that is the miracle of the movie The realism of the movie and it s performance by Bret Carr is not to be missed The very nature of it s almost interactive effect will cause people to leave the theater either liberated or questioning their very identity Bravo on the next level of cinema
1	This was a very good film I didn t go into it with very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the acting the script and the scenery Miranda Richardson was fantastic and so was Joan Plowright They stole the show But the other actors played their parts wonderfully also Very enjoyable film
1	I moved out here to get away from this kind of thing The small town sheriff laments This happens a lot in Chicago His deputy asks Well no not really The plot is that a group of Martians mistake a Halloween Rebroadcast of Orson Welles War of the Worlds as an account of a real Martian invasion and conclude they need to get in on the action What follows are a bunch of mishaps involving the Martian s haphazard attempts to conquer the town of Big Bean IL Everyone concludes they are kids in really good costumes except for the Sheriff s daughter and her friend a kid in a duck suit The Martians themselves are comical and you get the impression they are no threat to anyone but themselves pretty early on It s a fun family movie
0	i saw switching goals twice and always the same feeling you see the Olsen twins make same movie they like play different sports and then fall in love to boys OK now about the movie first off all such little boys and girls don t play on such big goals football does not play on time outs if the game is at its end the referee gives some overtime a minute or more and the finish is so foreseen i think that this movie is bad because of the lack of football knowledgement if it were done by European producers it would be better and also the mane actors aren t the wright choice they suffer from lack of authentic OK they played some seasons in full house but that doesn t make them big stars you have got to show your talent and that is what is missing in the Olsen twins
0	I should never have started this film and stopped watching after s I missed the really botched ending This film was a disappointment because it could have been so much better It had nice atmosphere a top notch cast and director good locations But a baaaaaad story line a bad script I paid attention to Kenneth Branagh s southern accent it was better than the script The plot was stupid driven by characters acting in unreal and improbable ways No one behaves like this outside of Hollywood scripts
0	This is an awful film Yea the girls are pretty but its not very good The plot having a cowboy get involved with an Indian maiden would be interesting if the sex didn t get in the way Well okay it might be interesting but its not because its so badly paced and and only partly acted I can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tushes looked like on a big screen probably more laughable then they do on TV I won t even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest Never read about that in the old west This is a film that requires liberal use of fast forward I like schlock films but this is ridiculous There is a reason that I don t go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good the plot taking a back seat to breasts The original nudie cuties as they are called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put butts in seats The clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent The comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level infantile but harmlessly fun Something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a nudie The Ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but its done in by being neither western nor sex film I need not watch this again Of interest to probably no one the rapist and killer in the film was played by Bobby Beausoleil a member of the Manson family who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after filming wrapped Obviously these sort of things will ruin some peoples lives
1	While Hollywood got sort of stagnant during the few years after WWII England developed a very prolific film industry In The Man in the White Suit inventor Sidney Stratton Alec Guinness creates a suit that never gets dirty Unfortunately this means that certain other businesses are now likely to go out of business How can Sidney deal with this and maintain his dignity This is an example of one of the great movies in which Alec Guinness starred before he became Obi Wan Kenobi It s a good look at the overall absurdity of the business world If you re planning to start any kind of business you might want to consider watching this movie
1	Fever Pitch is a sweet and charming addition to the small genre of sports romances as date movies or movies a son could be willing to go to with his mother though the guys in the audience got noticeably restless during the romantic scenes I have lived through a milder version of such a story as my first exposure to baseball was dating my husband the spring after the Mets first World Series win and then I watched the Mets clinch their next one because I was the one still up in the wee hours with our two little sons who have grown up to teach me more about baseball through our local neighborhood National League team s other heartbreaking failures to win it again and it was me who took our older son to his only Fenway Park game as I caught a bit of Red Sox fever as a graduate student in Boston So compared to reality the script believably creates two people with actual jobs It is particularly impressive that Drew Barrymore s character is a substantive workaholic who has anti Barbie skills though she pretty much only visits with her three bland girlfriends during gym workouts that allow for much jiggling and the minor side stories with her parents don t completely work It is even set up credibly how she meets Jimmy Fallon s math teacher and how she falls for his winter guy though it s surprising that his Red Sox paraphernalia filled apartment didn t tip her off to his Jekyll and Hyde summer guy Their relationship crisis during the baseball season is also played out in a refreshingly grown up way from efforts at compromise to her frank challenges to him centered around that they are both facing thirty and single Fallon surprisingly rises to his character s gradual emotional maturity While the ending borrows heavily from O Henry the script writers did a yeoman job of quickly incorporating the Sox s incredible season into a revised story line with lots of cooperation from the Red Sox organization for filming at the stadium The script goes out of its way to explain why Fallon doesn t have a Boston accent as an immigrant from New Jersey but that doesn t explain why his motley friends don t The most authentic sounding Boston sounds come from most of his summer family of other season ticket holders who kindly kibitz the basics of Sox lore to neophyte Barrymore and any such audience members The song selection includes many Red Sox fans favorites from the opening notes of the classic Dirty Water though most are held to be heard over the closing credits as if you are listening to local radio and are worth sitting through to hear
0	a friend gave it to me saying it was another classic like Debbie does Dallas Nowhere close I think my main complaint is about the most unattractive lead actress in porn industry ever Even more terrible is that she is on screen virtually all the time But I read somewhere that back in those days porn had to have some artistic value I was unable to find it though See it only if you are interested in history of development of porn into mainstream or can appreciate art in porn movies I know I am not But the director of the movie appears to be a talented person He even tried to get Simon Garfunkel to give him permissions to use his songs Of course they rejected
0	The s is an occasionally entertaining film most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film It is extremely uneven and includes many annoying elements Take for instance the switch between black white and color If done right this could of been fairly effective but because it was done poorly it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience much of the film had an odd feel to it The acting wasn t extremely bad for a made for TV flick but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times Many of the events were not coherent and ending up being confusing How did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the s The ending was much too sappy for my tastes because it was hollywoodized everything had to turn out right in the end I would advise you to not waste your time on The s and do something else with your time I m glad I watched this in class and not on my own time I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of Bob Dylan s music Those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick I hope you take my advice and stay away from this
0	This movie is a good example of how to ruin a book in minutes Except for the names of the characters the movie bears very little resemblance to the book A book full of strong Latino characters and they are represent for the most part by non Latinos There is no character development in the movie and we have no reason to love or hate the characters And to delete a complete generation is inexcusable Isabel Allende has written a powerful book and the book is what should be read
1	The Lion King series is easily the crowning achievement in Disney animation The original Lion King is the greatest masterpiece in cel animation Lion King II Simba s Pride is the BY FAR the best direct to video sequel that Disney or any other studio has made for an animated feature It deserved a theatrical release The same can be said for this movie It has the original cast songs by Elton John a hilarious story exciting action and touching character moments Everything you ve come to expect from this series Not so much a new story but filler and extended background on Timon and Pumbaa and their place in this story What impressed me the most was the care taken in the animation All to often Disney shorts on the animation quality of their video and television efforts But here they seamlessly blend new animation with footage from the original film The scenes never seem out of place Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are in full swing as Timon and Pumbaa Matthew Broderick Robert Guillame and Moira Kelly reprise their roles as Simba Rafiki and Nala respectively We even get a return visit by Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as the hyenas There are MANY big laughs in this movie So if you love Lion King you need this movie The story is just not complete without it
1	in a not so conventional sense of the word This movie was one of my favorites as a young child and I just recently remembered it and thought to look it up While many of the details are no longer clear in my mind the overall feeling that the movie gave me has stuck with me over the years If parents feel that their children can handle mature and sometimes violent themes then I highly recommend this movie It taught me a lot about life and death and brought forth in me a lot of emotion To this day it remains one of my favorite films
0	The version of The Haunting has been one of my favorite horror films for years so I anticipated the release of this remake with a good deal of trepidation It hardly seemed that any follow up could exceed or even equal the original masterpiece Unfortunately my worries were well founded This movie stinks I don t know what the people involved in this film were thinking Jan De Bont who seemed to have had a fluke when he directed the excellent Speed does as poorly here or perhaps even worse as he did with the much hyped duds Twister and Speed Cruise Control Hey Jan stick to cinematography would ya Liam Neeson is adequate in his role as the doctor pretending to be a sleep psychologist I don t think he is capable of turning in a truly bad performance but even he cannot save a lame script and weak story Catherine Zeta Jones proves once again as she did in Entrapment that she lacks the acting ability to rise above the material that is handed to her The female lead who did great in an episode of The X Files looks lost here as Eleanor an insomniac hovering on the edge of sanity And that blond guy whoever he is is more wooden than the laughably strange statuettes of children carved into the woodwork around the house I don t think he changes expression once during the entire film SPOILERS AHEAD The reason the first movie worked so well is because we were never sure whether the house was truly haunted or whether the manifestations were a result of Eleanor s precarious mental state No spirits are actually seen in the original leaving much up to the imagination a hallmark of other great horror films like The Changeling and The Blair Witch Project In this updated version we of course get tons of CGI ghosts which basically in the face of the weak script plot make the movie totally unscary The f x aren t even that great considering they were done by ILM The frozen breath looks particularly fake The effects in the underrated Peter Jackson film The Frighteners which I saw just before this one were a lot better The wooden carvings of the children which are supposed to look creepy just look silly especially when they scream and the CGI monsters are nothing to write home about Rather than providing a relief from the bad acting bad direction and bad writing the effects only add to this mess of a film Some particularly dumb scenes When the three other characters break into Eleanor s bedroom and none of them seem at all surprised to find a huge scowling demon hovering over the bed The scene where Eleanor sees the former lady of the house hanging from the rafters the acting here is particularly bad And last but not least the unintentionally hilarious bit where Wooden Blond Guy utters an uninspired shout of what is supposed to be anguish leaps up on a piece of furniture and starts slashing away at the painting of the old evil guy who built the house We actually get some satisfaction in this scene as seconds after his attack Blond Guy is dragged over to the fireplace by the ghost of the old guy and promptly gets his head cut off by the flue It was the only part of the movie I enjoyed In sum stick to the original The Haunting stars
0	I did not expect a lot from this movie after the terrible Life is a Miracle It turns out that this movie is ten times worse than Life I have impression that director writer is just joking with the audience let me see how much emptiness can you audience sustain Dialogues are empty scenario is minimalistic In few moments photography is really nice Few sarcastic lines are semi funny but it is hard to genuinely laugh during this comedy I ve laughed to myself for being able to watch the movie until the end If you can lift yourself above this director s fiasco you will find good acting of few legends Miki Manojlovic Aleksandar Bercek and very good performance of Emir s son Stribor Kusturica In short too bad for such a great director Emir Kusturica is still young and should be making top rated movies Instead he chooses to do this low budget just for my private theater movie with arrogant attitude toward the world trends and negligence toward his old fans
0	Yeah Madsen s character whilst talking to the woman from the TV station is right the LAPD IS a corrupt violent and racist police And this movie changes nothing about it Okay here are the good cops the moral cops even a black one whow a Christian a martyr But this is a fairy tale admit it Reality is not like that And most important for the action fans The shoot out is boring It s just shooting and shooting and shooting Nothing more Play Counter Strike then you will at least have something to do The only moral of this film is The LAPD is good now No more bad cops in it If you like uncritical euphemistic commercials for police and military service watch this movie It s the longest commercial I ve ever seen Points for camera and editing
1	Seeing as the vote average was pretty low and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was just OK I didn t have much expectations when renting this film But contrary to the above I enjoyed it a lot This is a charming movie It didn t need to grow on me I enjoyed it from the beginning Mel Brooks gives a great performance as the lead character I think somewhat different from his usual persona in his movies There s not a lot of knockout jokes or something like that but there are some rather hilarious scenes and overall this is a very enjoyable and very easy to watch film Very recommended
0	I LOVED the Apprentice for the first two seasons But now with season or is it things are getting just plain too tiring I used to like the show but its become Donald Trumps own ego fest Granted its his company you ll be working for but come on some of the things says You re FIRED is just insulting after watching the show I would not want to work for him not because he is arrogant pompous or such Its just that the show is unrealistic and the way he handles things makes me just squirm Good Entertainment YES but tiring as the back stabbing gets so tiring its not team work its not personal its just business watch your back jack
1	In answer to the person who made the comment about how the film drags on and who believed there was no purpose to the role of Jess s brother here is my response The role of Jess s brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story Craig Sheffer Norman could have foreseen the troubles associated with living life to the full by looking at how Jess s brother turned out There are various instances where Brad Pitt and his lives run in parallel for example when Jess s brother takes Craig Sheffer to a disjointed bar and subsequently he finds Brad Pitt there a few days later The dramatic irony was there so Craig Sheffer s character would have a bigger emotional turmoil at his brothers death knowing he could have done more to prevent it and subsequently creates a more compelling mood in the film
0	En route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway a female reporter runs into a strange hitch hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination The strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area in the first story an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman s husband but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie and in the second story a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes at making a zombie themed anthology a nice idea but with only two stories it falls woefully short And that s not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver the acting is lousy with Joe Haggerty as the tale telling Ebenezer Jackson giving one of the strangest performances I have ever seen the locations are uninspired the script is dreary there s a sex scene with zero nudity and the ending well that beggars belief To be fair some of Sykes creative camera work is effective although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused and Joe Castro s cheapo gore is enthusiastic an ear is bitten off eyeballs are plucked out a face is removed brains are squished and there is a messy decapitation These positives just about make the film bearable but be warned The Zombie Chronicles ain t a stroll in the park even for seasoned viewers of z grade trash I give The Zombie Chronicles but generously raise my rating to since I didn t get to view the film with the benefit of D although I have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn t have made that much of a difference
1	When I first heard that Hal Hartley was doing a sequel to Henry Fool I was excited it s been a personal favorite for years now and then wary when I heard it had something to do with terrorism Having just seen it though I was surprised to find that it worked while still being an entirely different sort of movie than Henry Fool The writing and direction were both dead on and the acting was superb especial kudos go to Hartley for reassembling virtually the whole cast right down to Henry s son who was only four in the original Like I said though this movie is quite different from the first but it works I reconciled myself with the change in tone and subject matter to the fact that years have passed and the characters would have found themselves in very different situations since the first film ended In this case an unexpected adventure ensues and that s about all I ll give away not to mention the fact that I ll need to see it again to really understand what s going on and who s double crossing who While it was certainly one of the better movies I ve seen in some time it suffers like many sequels with its ending as it appears that Hartley is planning a third now and the film leaves you hanging I ll be sure to buy my tickets for part Henry Grim in
1	The th animated Disney classic is a reasonable movie told through a simple story Even though a little dated it deserves a place in the list of Disney classics It s not among Disney s top works but is satisfying One of Disney s most simple works yes but keeps a certain magic and enchantment which old Disney is well known for This was an important movie because it saved Disney from a delicate situation If this was a failure there wouldn t be any more Disney animated classics Cinderella is somehow like a return to Disney s st animated classic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs because it brings back the fairy tale genre It s not clear where the story takes place but I suppose it s somewhere in France because this is based in a tale by Charles Perrault There are plenty of likable characters such as Cinderella the Prince Bruno the dog Jaques and Gus the two main mice the Fairy Godmother for a fairy she sure is funny the birds the King and the Grand Duke Jaques is very smart and amusing I love his voice Really has that mouse like quality Gus might not be that smart but he s humorous The King is hilarious but I think that what makes him so funny is his short temper The Grand Duke is a very cool chap and funny too They re two of my favorite characters in this film and responsible for many of the most amusing moments The Prince is certainly one of the most charming in Disney No doubt that Prince Philip from Sleeping Beauty was inspired on this prince because they are very similar looking On the other hand Lady Tremaine the stepmother isn t supposed to be likable because she s cold jealous bitter and cruel Her daughters Anastacia and Drizella aren t much better than her However the stepmother isn t as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters Cinderella the main character has nothing to do with them Cinderella is gentle kind pretty and lovable By the way I think her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the one given by the Fairy Godmother Lucifer the cat is hilariously malicious The way he walks sticking up his nose in the air and those arrogant and snobbish facial expressions make him funny Ironically he s very much like the stepmother when it comes to personality He always agrees with the stepmother s attitudes towards Cinderella Lucifer has the right name for him because he s such a devilish and mean cat Yet there s nothing annoying about him The soundtrack is simple but pleasant although not among Disney s best The best song in this movie is Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo There are plenty of well known talented voice actors in this such as James MacDonald Marion Darlington Eleanor Audley Verna Felton and Luis Van Rooten Despite being simple looking the movie has good artwork as well as its nice details although never something out of this world However the King s palace is a spectacular masterpiece being truly majestic and colossal
0	Hollywood always had trouble coming to terms with a religious picture Strange Cargo proves to be no exception Although utilizing the talents of a superb cast and produced on a top budget with suitably moody photography by Robert Planck the movie fails dismally on the credibility score Perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements upsets the viewer s involvement in the action and with the fate of the characters I found it difficult to sit still through all the contrived metaphors parallels and biblical references and impossible to accept bathed in light Ian Hunter s smug know it all as a Christ figure And the censors in Boston Detroit and Providence at least agreed with me The movie was banned Few Boston Detroit Providence moviegoers if any complained or journeyed to other cities because it was obvious from the trailer that Gable and Crawford had somehow become involved in a message picture It flopped everywhere Oddly enough the movie has enjoyed something of a revival on TV A home atmosphere appears to make the movie s allegory more receptive to viewers However despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film the plot of this Strange Cargo flows along predictable heavily moralistic lines that will have no one guessing how the principal characters will eventually come to terms with destiny

1	When you are in a gloomy or depressed mood go watch this film It shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday setting and it is very encouraging in particular from a feminist and a humanist perspective When you know both the Turkish language and either the Danish or the German language go watch the film in any case Half of the dialog is Danish in the original synchronized to German in the translated version the other half Turkish subtitled in Danish or German respectively When i watched it in Mannheim Germany the reaction of the Turkish speaking audience proved that there must be a lot of humor in the Turkish dialog which deplorably mostly escaped me being only imperfectly rendered in the subtitles Still the film is interesting even if you lack knowledge of the Turkish Esthetically the movie is playing a lot on the theme of speed and slowness On first sight there is lots of corporeal movement fast as lightning making it a quick an agitated film In particular even though this is a Kung Fu movie watch out for the running scenes beautifully expressing a wealth of emotions But there are quite a few very slow emotionally intense scenes too And above all the characters develop at a much slower pace than you would expect in a drama about the coming of age still there is some movement in the characters to Closely watch the villain Omar whose part and acting i liked very much The contrast of speed and stillness nicely contributes to the depiction of human rage and dignity shown at once in the same characters at the same time
1	This movie has a lot of comedy not dark and Gordon Liu shines in this one He displays his comical side and it was really weird seeing him get beat up His training is unorthodox and who would ve thought knot tying could be so deadly Lots of great stunts and choreography Very creative Add Johnny Wang in the mix and you ve got an awesome final showdown Don t mess with Manchu thugs they re ruthless
0	Carnosaur Primal Species D Jonathan Winfrey Scott Valentine Janet Gunn Rick Dean Anthony Peck Rodger Halston Terri J Vaughn Billy Burnette Why even bother reviewing this movie Another stupid dinosaur movie in which top secret military guys discover those lethal and very fake looking prehistoric monsters running around killing people in gory ways The original was bad enough the sequel was even worse This falls somewhere in between though unrelated to either of the previous CARNOSAUR films RATING out of Rated R for graphic violence and gore grisly images and profanity
1	Saw this film yesterday for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it I m a student of screen writing and I loved the way the minor characters intervened just when something pivotal climatic happened in a scene I thought the dialogue was very sharp and the premise of story is rather shocking at one particular point Barbara Stanwyck is openly flirting with her daughter s boyfriend AND rekindling some passion in her husband whom she hasn t seen in ten years AND with the gunshot signal two shots and then one she hooks up with her old shag mate Dutch the reason she left town in the first place ALL AT THE SAME TIME The moral majority must have been totally incensed when they saw this flick back in the s Love the costumes and cinematography and the straight from the hip dialogue just to watch Barbara Stanwyck and Co doing the Bunny Hug is good enough reason to rent this film on DVD One of the best films from that period I ve seen in a long time
1	This show is totally worth watching It has the best cast of talent I have seen in a very long time The premise of the show is unique and fresh I guess the executives at ABC are not used too that as it was not another reality show However this show was believable with likable characters and marvelous story lines I am probably not in the age group they expect to like the show as I am in my forty s but a lot of my friends also loved it Late s mid s and are dying for quality shows with talented cast members I do not think this show was given enough time to gain an audience I believe that given more time this show would have done very well Once again ABC is not giving a show with real potential a real chance With so many shows given chance after chance and not nearly worth it They need to give quality shows a real chance and the time to really click and gain an audience I really loved the characters and looked forward to watching each episode I have been watching the episodes on ABC videos and the show keeps getting better and better Although I think they owe us one more episode Number We want to watch what we can Bombard ABC with emails and letters and see if its possible to save this show from extinction It certainly worked for Jerico Some things are just worth saving and this show is definitely one of them SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION TO ABC AT http www PetitionOnline com gh petition html
1	In addition to being an extremely fun movie may I add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful This kind fun loving woman had a great deal of money Unfortunately she also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their hands on her money This woman was lonely since the death of her husband He had proposed to her in a theater that was going to be torn down To prevent that she bought it Her daughters were afraid she was throwing away their money and decided to take action The character actors in this film were a great plus also I would give almost anything to have a copy of this film in my video library but as of yet it s never been released Sad
1	I saw The Big Bad Swim at the Temecula film festival and was totally caught off guard by how much I was drawn into it The film centers around the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class for various reasons A humorous idea in its own right the class serves as a catalyst for greater changes in the students lives What surprised me about the film was how real it felt Rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so well I enjoyed the scenes in the class immensely and the drama that took place outside was very poignant Nothing seemed out of place or out of character and ultimately it left a very strong feeling much like attending school or summer camp where you find fast friends form strong bonds and make discoveries about yourself yet have to depart all too soon My only complaint was that the character of Paula had a very strong and unusual introduction which made you want to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed I suppose you don t get to meet everyone in class though Aside from this I found the film very well rounded and quite enjoyable See it if you get the opportunity
0	The teasers for Tree of Palme try to pass it off as a sort of allegory for a fairy tale with actual meaning then immediately start raving about the animation I should have known what that meant The main character Palme is a good example of the whole movie s problem One minute Palme is a humble hero in search of himself the next a violent psycho with an unhealthy fixation on a girl he once took care of Like all of the characters in the movie Palme is poorly defined You do not bond with the characters at all although Shatta has acquired a couple of fan girls It seems that the writer was more interested in cramming all the drama and complexity he could into this movie than actually exploring his characters motivations and personalities New useless story lines were being introduced in the last fifteen minutes of the movie The writer seriously needed to streamline his story Perhaps he was trying to be epic but it was simply too much information for a two hour movie However I can t help but wonder if a plot with so many dimensions and characters would have been better suited for a TV series or graphic novel In the last five minutes of the movie I simply could not endure the sheer lack of quality any longer and began laughing at how contrived the characters the relationships and the whole plot was I touched my companion and he started cracking up too as did a young man seated behind us We tried so hard to control ourselves but we simply could not take the terrible quality of this movie On the bright side the animation is incredible and viewers will find themselves admiring the lush backgrounds and charming character designs The animation almost guides you when you don t care about the characters it tells you how to feel
1	I dont know why people think this is such a bad movie Its got a pretty good plot some good action and the change of location for Harry does not hurt either Sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movie like that Eastwood is in good form as Dirty Harry and I liked Pat Hingle in this movie as the small town cop If you liked DIRTY HARRY then you should see this one its a lot better than THE DEAD POOL
1	This is my FAVORITE ALL time movie It used to be my Friday night movie with a pizza and bottle of wine when I was single I first saw this movie with my aunt Brend and sister Chasity I was in the nd grade I fell in LOVE with Travolta and Sissy was my new best friend I ve read a lot of comments about why Bud left Sissy how Sissy has to learn to act married But let s go back and look at this for a second SPOILER My interpretation of the movie now not when I was eight is this about Bud Sissy s relationship takes a turn for the worst because she makes a fool of him at Gilley s riding the bull They get in a huge fight Bud tries to make Sissy jealous by asking Pam to dance Sissy then thinks two wrongs will make a right and Wes asks her if she needs any help They re all on the dance floor acting like fools when Bud asks Pam when are you going to take me home and rape me Pam answers When ever you re ready Cowboy Bud then goes home with Pam to her condo in downtown Houston Which Daddy has bought for her with his oil money and all that that implies Bud is the one who cheats on Sissy Sissy is waiting for Bud when he returns home the next day Sissy is the ONE who leaves Bud Then it s up to Bud to prove to Sissy that he is a real cowboy and win her back Anyways that s my interpretation Everyone has their I m sure I love this movie And believe it or not I got myself a REAL cowboy I love him too
0	The definition of an abomination as defined by Webster s Dictioary is a cause of abhorrence or disgust If someone can think of a more appropriate word or definition than this for Alone in the Dark please let me know because this is the best I can come up with However I do no feel that in anyway this word describes how truly awful this film is I went to see this film with two of my roommates One has very similar tastes to me the other is an action adventure flick guru This latter guy usually doesn t care about the size of the plot holes as long as the movie contains lots of explosions he will walk away satisfied That being said we entered the theater for the Friday viewing of Alone in the Dark Little to my surprise we were the only people in the theater When it started I knew why immediately It begins with the worst opening scene of any movie and unfortunately I have to admit it only gets worse from there The opening scene is a minute scroll text that is narrated Yet I understand why it was narrated The director must have understood that only illiterate people would even ascertain the thought of PAYING to see this movie Yet not only is this first scene the longest scroll text in the history of cinema but it also makes no sense It seems as if in the same sequence we are hearing about to completely separate movies One is about an ancient civilization and its tampering with a portal the other is about a crazy scientist and his experiments on orphans If you are reading this and are confused you are not alone Then the awful storyline acting effects and camera work begin Tara Reid is horrendous as an actress She does nothing to even for one second make you think that she is a museum curator Slater is just bad not convincing and has no chemistry with Reid The plot is probably the worst thing ever created by man The entire time myself and the roommate with similar tastes are asking questions like What is this And what is going on Other than this scrolling garbage we have a few narrated sequences by Slater himself Are they good NO Do they explain anything NO Do we at any point as an audience have the slightest inkling as to why we should care what happens Once again NO Then we have a random sex scene We are told that Slater and Reid are together yet at no time do they act as though they even care about on another But then BAM sex scene Once again I don t know A good oh i don t know seconds after that woeful scene ends we have a gunfight with or so military and a similar number of alien things This is set to a heavy metal track and causes more brain hemorrhaging than one ever thought possible And if that wasn t enough There exists no main villain There is the scientist and there are the alien things At one point the scientist controls the alien things and stands on a hill commanding them to attack the military outpost Why How did he become the supreme commander of these things Why do they listen to him Once again I have no idea The movie ends with Slater and Reid walking in an evacuated city Why was the city evacuated Did the alien things break through Did the military tell them Who knows and by this point who cares I didn t and you won t But to top it off Slater and Reid are attacked by an alien thing Even though it was stated that alien things will be killed by exposure to sunlight And thats right you guessed it it the middle of the ing day and it s bright as can be Maybe the alien thing bought a pair of sunglasses I don t know and I don t care Now after the movie ended I ran outside the theater all foot inches of me waving my arms and shaking my afro telling everyone not to go see this movie Even my gung ho action adventure roommate who would consider a movie that just cut and pasted hours of explosion into film to be the greatest thing ever created admitted that plot holes were very evident in this film To sum up this CRAP FEST i give it a and would give it lower if I could Unequivocally the worst movie ever made I wouldn t wish this movie on my worst enemy
0	This movie was rented by a friend Her choice is normally good I read the cover first and was expecting a good movie Although itwas a horror movie Which i don t prefer But no horror came to mind while watching the movie It was a dull not very entertaining movie The appearance of Denise Richardswas again a pleasure for the eye But that s it We the four of us we re a little bit disappointed But feel free to see this movie andjudge it yourself

0	to movie this movie felt like one of those after school specials only lower budget and lower everything else i guess this was supposed to an inspirational movie of some sort but it didn t work for me yet some how it comes across as preachy it has very pale shades of Flash Dance but so what there just isn t any excitement in this movie the dialogue is contrived and clich d to death of course the whole movie feels like a bad s clich the acting was less than stellar though that has a lot to do with what the actors were given or in this case not to work with on top of that is the poor song choices with really bad lyrics i felt embarrassed for all the actors involved they are all talented but you can t tell from this movie this is just my opinion of course but i have to give Flying AKA Dream to Believe a
0	This British film is truly awful and it s hard to believe that Glenn Ford is in it although he pretty much sleepwalks through it The idea of a bomb on a train sounds good but it turns out this train ends up parked for the majority of the film No action no movement just a static train The area where the train is parked is evacuated so it s not like there s any danger to anyone either In fact this film could be used in a film class to show how NOT to make a suspense film True suspense is generated by letting the audience know things that the characters don t a fact apparently unknown to the director SPOILER the train actually has two bombs on it but we are led to believe there is only one After the first bomb is defused it feels as if there is no longer a reason to watch the film any more But at the last minute the villain who has no apparent motivation for his actions reveals there are two Nor are we certain WHEN the bombs will go off so we don t even have a classic ticking bomb tension sequence A good minutes or more are spent watching Glenn Ford s French wife thinking about leaving him and then wondering where he is She s such an annoying character that we don t care whether she reconciles with him so when she does there s nothing emotional about it Most of the other characters are fairly devoid of personality and none have any problems or issues It s only minutes but it feels long because it s tedious and dull Don t waste your time
1	The Invisible Ray is an excellent display of both the acting talents of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi Karloff pulls off a flawless performance as a sullen and conflicted scientist who appears to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others even his wife His already loner personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid Lugosi plays the consummate professional who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain on good terms with everyone but still seems to have no real close friends This was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it very well It is hard however to hear his accent and believe he is French The biggest problem with the movie was that it was all based on junk science but in a way even the junk science makes it work well Since the ideas and theories are completely idiotic they are as relevant today as they were when the movie was made And they are also as forward reaching and always will be This is a perfectly delightful movie to watch again and again I saw it maybe times this weekend and I could easily sit through it five more times The acting is marvelous and the science is amusing I highly recommend it

1	Being half portuguese doesn t render me half blind nor half prejudiced when discussing portuguese films Not that I get to do that very often anyway But this film was such a rush of adrenaline Yes that s right it was mostly accurate as far as history went goes but it pulled no punches on venturing beyond usual portuguese film territory things like using real locations in the middle of traffic congested Lisbon and recruiting a real crowd to stand in for the real crowd of almost years ago And by God did they get it right OK to sum it up very emotional if you ve lived through it but you ll spot minor improvements that could have been made as well as plot necessities that were If you re just watching it randomly you re in for a good historical romp only of the very recent History kind and a bit more thought proving than usual Even by European standards yes
0	This version moved a little slow for my taste and I suppose I have problems with this play to begin with But first the movie it s a typical TV movie version of a play which means it doesn t have the flair of the original film version with William Holden What they couldn t afford to hire more than twelve people as extras Why move the movie up to So you could give the little sister a line about the Vietnam war protests Why not and give her a line about the civil rights movement As for the casting some hits some misses Jay O Sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with Josh Brolin Brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the notes He s believable as an ex BMOC jock but he doesn t have the raw sensuality of William Holden I always thought Brolin looks a little bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town go ape over him pardon the pun Gretchen Moll was lovely but she seemed a little too wise for the character she played She didn t project the innocence or ignorance that the character required Maybe it s because she and Brolin were about years older than the characters should be But then again Holden was ten years too old Bonnie Bedelia was rather forgettable as the mother and Mary Steenburgen can t seem to make up her mind whether she was playing Blanche duBois or Katharine from The Taming of The Shrew As for Mr Inge s play I always felt that stories like this of a young woman choosing passion over practicality always needed an epilogue The Twilight Zone I believe offer a likely epilogue with the episode Spur of the Moment where a young Diana Hyland was being chased by a bitter older Diana Hyland because the younger Diana Hyland chose to run off with a guy similar to Hal Carter
1	The movie celebrates life The world is setting itself for the innocent and the pure souls and everything has Happy End just like in the closing scene of the movie The movie has wonderful soundtrack mixture of Serbian neofolk Gypsy music and jazz This movie is very refreshing piece of visual poetics The watching experience is like you ve been sucked in another colorful romantic and sometimes rough world Like Mr Kusturica movie should be
0	John Boorman s The General was hailed as a major comeback though it s hard to see why on the evidence of the film itself One of three films made that year about famed Northern Irish criminal Martin Cahill alongside Ordinary Decent Criminal and Vicious Circles it has an abundance of incident and style the film was shot in colour but released in b w Scope in some territories but makes absolutely no impact and just goes on forever With a main character who threatens witnesses car bombs doctors causes a hundred people to lose their jobs tries to buy off the sexually abused daughter of one of his gang to keep out of jail and nails one of his own to a snooker table yet still remains a popular local legend an attractive enough personality for his wife to not only approve but actually suggest a m nage a trios with her sister it needs a charismatic central performance to sell the character and the film It doesn t get it Instead it s lumbered with what may well be Brendan Gleeson s worst and most disinterested performance he delivers his lines and stands in the right place but there s nothing to suggest either a local hero or the inner workings of a complex character On the plus side this helps not to overglamorize a character who is nothing more than an egotistical thug but it s at odds with a script that seems to be expecting us to love him and his antics There s a minor section that picks up interest when the IRA whips up a local hate campaign against the General and his men painting them as anti social drug dealers purely because Cahill won t share his loot from a robbery with them but its temporary resolution is so vaguely shot something to do with Cahill donning a balaclava and joining the protesters which we re expected to find lovably cheeky that it s just thrown away Things are more successful in the last third as the pressure mounts and his army falls apart but by then it s too late to really care Adrian Dunbar Maria Doyle Kennedy and the gorgeous Angeline Ball do good work in adoring supporting roles but Jon Voight s hammy Garda beat cop seems to be there more for American sales than moral balance overcompensating for Gleeson s comatose non involvement in what feels like a total misfire Come back Zardoz all is forgiven
0	My kid makes better videos than this I feel ripped off of the spent renting this thing There is no date on the video case apparently designed by Wellspring and what s even worse there s no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie The only date given is leading an unsuspecting renter to believe he s getting a recent film This movie was so bad from a standpoint of being outdated and irrelevant for any time period but precisely when it was made that I m amazed that anyone would take the time and expense to market it as a video It might be of interest to students studying the counter culture of the s the anti war anti establishment tune in turn on and drop out culture but when you read the back of the video case there s no hint that that is what you re getting If you do make the mistake of renting it though it is probably best viewed while on drugs so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors Fassbinder and Fengler Regardless of your state of mind while watching it I can tell you that it doesn t get any better after the first scene so knowing that I m sure you ll be fast asleep long before the end
1	This film reminds me of nd Street starring Bebe Daniels and Ruby Keeler When I watch this film a lot of it reminded me of nd Street especially the character Eloise who s a temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle like Bebe Daniels did in nd Street and another performer gets the part and become a star This film like most race films keeps people watching because of the great entertainment Race films always showed Black Entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era The Dancing Styles The Music Dressing Styles You ll Love It This movie could of been big if it was made in Hollywood it would of had better scenery better filming and more money which would make any movie better But its worth watching because it is good and Micheaux does good with the little he has I have to say out of all Micheaux s films Swing is the best The movie features singers dancers actresses and actors who were popular but forgotten today Doli Armena a awesome female trumpet player who can blow the horn so good that you think Gabriel is blowing a horn in the sky The sexy hot female dancer Consuela Harris would put Ann Miller and Gyspy Rose Lee to shame Adding further info Popular blues singer of the s and s Cora Green is the focus of the film she s Mandy a good hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women A nosy neighbor played by Amanda Randolph tells Mandy what she seen and heard and Mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive curvy woman by the name of Eloise played Hazel Diaz a Hot Cha entertainer in the s and a fight breaks out Then Mandy goes to Harlem where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel Lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies Dorothy Van Engle Lena provides Mandy with a home a job and helps her become a star when temperamental Cora Smith played by Hazel I guess she s playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior When Cora gets drunk and breaks her leg Lena convinces everyone that Mandy is right for the job and Lena is right and a star is born in Mandy Tall long lanky but handsome Carman Newsome is the cool aspiring producer who Lena looks out for as well Pretty boy Larry Seymour plays the no good man but after Lena threatens him he might shape up There are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where Cora Smith Hazel Diaz struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but that s not enough she almost gets into a fight with Mandy again In between there s great entertainment by chorus girls tap dancers shake dancers swing music and blues singing There s even white people watching the entertainment I wonder where Micheaux found them there s even a scene where there s blacks and whites sitting together at the club Micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films he should be commended for such a bold move This movie was the first race film I really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to Oscar Micheaux This movie is one of the best of the race film genre its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show business No these early race films may not be the best can t be compared with Hallelujah Green Pastures Stormy Weather Cabin In The Sky Carmen Jones or any other Hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black film making and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black person s eyes These films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life be beautiful classy and elegant and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in Hollywood Most of the actors and actresses of these race films weren t the best but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time Micheaux and Spencer Williams couldn t afford Nina Mae McKinney Josephine Baker Ethel Waters Fredi Washington Paul Robeson Rex Ingram and more of the bigger stars so Micheaux and other black and white race film makers would use nightclub performers in their movies some were good some weren t great actors and actresses but I think Micheaux and others knew most weren t good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent they just wanted their stories told and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films For some true actors actresses race films were the only type of films they could get work especially if they didn t want to play Hollywood stereotypes so I think you ll be able to spot the true actors actresses from the nightclub performers These race films are very historic they could have been lost forever many are lost maybe race films aren t the greatest example of cinema but even Hollywood films didn t start out great in the beginning I think if the race film genre continued it would have better If your looking for great acting most race films aren t the ones but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films than watch race films There are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast Moon Over Harlem Body and Soul Paradise In Harlem Keep Punching Sunday Sinners Dark Manhattan Broken Strings Boy What A Girl Mystery In Swing Miracle In Harlem and Sepia Cinderella that not only has good entertainment but good acting
1	I m surprised at the comments from posters stating that Jane Powell made the same type of films Deanna Durbin did Although they were both young sopranos whose film images were crafted by Joe Pasternak if this film is any indication they were almost polar opposites While in THREE SMART GIRLS Durbin plays an impulsive Little Miss Fixit who after some setbacks manages to reunite her divorced parents in its semi remake THREE DARING DAUGHTERS Jane Powell almost destroys the marriage between her screen Mom Jeanette MacDonald and new stepfather Jose Iturbi when she refuses to accept him and strong arms her younger siblings into rejecting him too From the Durbin and Powell films I ve seen I d say these disparate qualities permeate the early films of both of these talented young performers As for Durbin s performance in THREE SMART GIRLS I find it completely winning and most impressive Although it s clear from her occasionally shrill and over emphatic line readings in some of the more energetic scenes that this is an early film for Deanna watching the self confident knowing and naturally effervescent manner in which she delivers her lines and performs overall and the subdued and tender manner she projects the more serious scenes you d never guess that this was the FIRST film role of a year old girl whose prior professional experience consisted almost exclusively of two years of vocal instruction Given that this film and Durbin herself were much publicized at the time as Universal s last chance the production must have been an impossibly stressful situation for a film novice of any age but you d never know it from the ease and assurance Durbin displays on screen Although she s clearly still developing her acting style and demeanor before the camera this was equally true of the early performances of much more experienced contemporaries like Garland Rooney O Connor and Jane Powell Durbin projects an extraordinary presence and warmth on camera that is absolutely unique to her and even here in her first film she manages to remain immensely likable despite the often quick tempered impulsiveness of her character and though she s occasionally shrill she never for a second projects the coy and arch qualities that afflicted many child stars including Jane Powell and some of the other young sopranos who followed in the wake of her success In short like all great singing stars Durbin was much more than just a beautiful voice On the other hand while Durbin s pure lyric soprano is a truly remarkable and glorious instrument the most remarkable thing about it to me was the way she is able to project her songs without the slightest bit of affectation or grandnes that afflict the singing of adult opera singers like Lily Pons Grace Moore and Jeanette MacDonald in films of the periodThe film is also delightful heavily influenced by screwball comedy it backs Durbin up with a creme de la creme of first class screwball pros such as Charles Winninger Binnie Barnes Alice Brady Ray Milland and Mischa Auer The story is light and entertaining True it s hardly realistic but why would anyone expect it to be If you want realistic rent THE GRAPES OF WRATH or TRIUMPH OF THE WILL On the other hand if you re looking for a genuine sweet funny and entertaining family comedy with a wonderfully charismatic and gifted adolescent lead and terrific supporting players this film won t let you down

0	As I sat in front of the TV watching this movie I thought Oh what Alfred Hitchcock or even Brian DePalma could have done with this Chances are you will too It does start out intrigueing A British park ranger living in Los Angeles Collin Firth marries a pretty demure brunette woman Lisa Zane whom he met in a park only a short time ago Then one day she dissappears The police are unable to find any documentation that she ever existed and Firth conducts his own search So far so good Just as he s about to give up he turns to his womanizing best friend Billy Zane and they stumble onto her former life in L A s sordid underground of drugs nightclubs and ametuer filmmaking and then to her history of mental instability At that point Firth s life is in danger and the film falls apart None of the characters from Lisa Zane s past are remotely interesting The film moves slowly and there s very little action There is a subplot regarding missing drug money but it s just a throwaway No chases no cliffhanging sequences and no suspense Just some dull beatings and a lot of chat by boring characters One thing worth noting Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brother and sister but they never appear in a scene together By the end of the movie you re torn between wondering what might have been and trying to stay awake
1	Inspired at least a little by Ivy Benson Her All Girls Orchestra who performed throughout the war years at the Covent Garden Opera house this film chronicles the attempts by an elderly saxophone player to reform the almost all girl band with whom she played as a schoolgirl towards the end of WWII All too brief flashbacks to the original band on stage bring us some wonderful music and help to fill in the background to the band members and in particular to the girls relationships with the lone male member their transvestite drummer who is trying to dodge the call up Ian Holm Lord of The Rings Cromwell and Fairfax and Judi Dench turn in superb leading performances as the recently widowed Elizabeth and the conniving womanizing Patrick the drummer The late Joan Sims is perfect as the band s leader now playing bar piano at the sea side and June Whitfield glows as the Salvation Army trombone player Cameo appearances by other greats like Cleo Laine Leslie Caron Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience The movie is a romp down memory lane with an all star cast of what ought by all rights to be a bunch of over the hill actresses All I can say is I hope I look as good at their age Leslie Caron in particular is still an incredible fox at years of age She certainly still gets my pulse going As I watched it I was mentally berating the casting director for not using women of the appropriate age Afterwards I looked these girls up and discovered that every one of them is old enough to have been performing in the London of although this might be a bit of a stretch for Judi Dench If you like swing bands thrive on nostalgia or just want to see how good a woman can manage look with almost three quarters of a century behind her don t miss this film
0	Songwriter Robert Taylor as Terry is dizzy slap happy and can t see straight over otherworldly Norma Shearer as Consuelo She makes the sun shine even when it s raining Mr Taylor explains But Mr Taylor gets a lump in his throat whenever he gets near Ms Shearer Finally at the Palm Beach casino Shearer frequents Taylor proclaims I love you Shearer brushes him off as she is engaged to George Sanders as Tony However to settle a gambling debt Shearer hires Taylor to pose as Her Cardboard Lover to make Mr Sanders jealous This film s title invites the obvious and appropriate three word review Her Cardboard Movie It is most notable as the last film appearance for Shearer one of the biggest stars in the world from He Who Gets Slapped playing another Consuelo to The Women To be fair this was likely the kind of Shearer film MGM believed audiences wanted to see However the part is unflattering Plucked and powered Taylor and Shearer were better off in The Escape If Shearer had continued she might have become a better actress than leading lady apparently she was no longer interested and certainly didn t need the money Taylor has a great scene reciting Christina Rossetti s When I am Dead My Dearest while threatening to jump from Shearer s balcony as directed by George Cukor Her Cardboard Lover George Cukor Norma Shearer Robert Taylor George Sanders
0	The minute you give an art film you have people baying for your ignorant half ass ed artistically retarded blood I won t try and justify how I am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the art house cinema I have liked or mentioning how I gave some unknown cult classic a All I ask is that someone explain to me the point purpose and message of this film Here is how I would summarize the film Opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of co incidence This followed by in a nutshell to save you hours of pain the following A children s game show host dying of lung cancer tries to patch things up with his coke addicted daughter who he may or may not have raped when she was a child and who is being courted by a bumbling police officer with relationship issues while the game show s star contestant decides that he doesn t want to be a failed child prodigy a fate which has befallen another one of the game show contestants from the s who we see is now a jobless homosexual in love with a bartender with braces and in need of money for corrective oral surgery while the game show s producer himself dying of lung cancer asks his male nurse to help him patch up with the son he abandoned years ago and who has subsequently become a womanizing self help guru even as Mr Producer s second wife suffers from guilt pangs over having cheated a dying man and oh eventually it rains frogs You read correctly And I am sparing you the unbelievably long and pointless literally rambling monologues each character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or reason other than possibly to make sure the film crosses hours and becomes classified as a modern epic You are probably thinking that I could have done a better job of summarizing the movie and in turn of not confusing you if I had written the damn thing a little more coherently maybe in a few sentences instead of just one Well now you know how I feel
0	Best of the Best is better than but just barely Basically I say this because part doesn t contradict parts like does ie their is no reference to Tommy Lee having siblings Anyway I liked the Russian plot line of the story and especially Sven Ole Thorsen s bit part as Boris Aside from that though and a few fighting scenes the movie is nothing special The limited budget is also very noticeable especially in the airplane blow up scene Also part does not really have a moral or say anything like part did there are a couple of more better known actors Hudson Thorsen in part but alas nothing like the beginning of the series and even these characters have very small roles Alas it seems Best of the Best is the Rhee show and to be truthful he cannot carry a movie Saw on tape Rating
0	Back in I caught this thing I can t even call it a movie on cable I was in college and I was with a high school friend whose hormones were raging out of control I figured out early on that this was hopeless Stupid script a bunch of old guys hiring some young guys to show them how to score with women bad acting with one exception and pathetic jokes The plentiful female nudity here kept my friend happy for a while but even he was bored after minutes in Remember this was a HIGH SCHOOL BOY This was back before nudity was so easy to get to by the Internet and such We kept watching hoping for something interesting or funny but that never happened The funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted this film was crap One poster had a fictional review that said This is the best movie I ve seen this afternoon Only Grant Cramer in the lead showed any talent and has actually gone on to a career in the business No budget and boring t a Skip it
1	I watched the presentation of this on PBS in the U S when it originally aired in Assuming the miniseries was available on DVD I purchased first editions of all three books last year Since then I have been searching for the series on internet movie sites Today I found this web site I will give up the search I too would like to buy this complete episodes miniseries After buying the DVDs I would read each book then watch the episodes for that book That is what I did with John LeCarre s Karla trilogy and Larry McMurty s Texas ranger trilogy Does anyone have any suggestions for great books or book series that became very good TV miniseries or movie series that are now available on DVD
1	Noll s comfortable way of rolling out blunt comments often with expletives to describe things that he is more knowledgeable about than most is quite refreshing There is one other character in the film that constantly tries to verbalize complicated issues using more language than necessary This guy should never have been given a Thesaurus Cut to Noll and you know you re in for a treat The way the pioneers of big wave surfing are portrayed is very evocative of a lost era Nevermind the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living much less took care of issues like medical care The use of old film clips throughout was masterfully done
1	This is a great British film A cleverly observed script with many quotable lines which captures perfectly what magic mushrooms can do to a man over a weekend As per usual Phil Daniels is excellent along with that most under rated of British actors Geoff Bell Peter Bowles with a joint hanging out of his mouth is a casting masterstroke and Gary Stretch with his brooding looks brings something strangely atmospheric to the piece Although it seems to be billed as a biker movie i think it will find an audience outside of this purely on the premise that a lot of people have been there done it and got the t shirt also A great original soundtrack with a blinding version of Freebird This really could be a st century heir to the famous Ealing comedies Like the weed in the Welsh fields it s a grower
1	I loved watching Sea Hunt back in the day I was in grammar school and would get home do my homework and by would be ready to watch Sea Hunt and Mike Nelson in his underwater adventures I loved it He took to you a place not very accessible at that time under the great blue sea Pre Thunderball or even before Cousteau became common there was Mike Nelson sparking the imagination of kids I d be willing to wager that more than a few kids developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences from watching this show Underwater photography also progressed the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated thru watching this show Watch and enjoy
1	I went into this movie knowing nothing about it and ended up really enjoying it It lacked authenticity and believability Some of the things that the characters said and did were completely bizarre and a lot of the script seemed like it was ad libbed perhaps this is typical of Woody Allen Excuse my ignorance but the whole audience in the theater was laughing so hard It wasn t even at the jokes in the movie per se but at the whole movie itself The acting reminded me of Seinfeld s acting where he tries not to laugh at his own jokes they are corny but if you don t take the movie too seriously you can really appreciate the humour of the ACTORS not the CHARACTERS If you re looking for a random movie and you like Woody Allen I d definitely recommend it
1	I ve seen this movie when I was traveling in Brazil I found it difficult to really understand Brazilian culture and society because it has so many regional and class differences To see this movie in Sao Paulo itself was a revelation It shows something of the everyday life of many Brazilians On the other side it is sometimes a little bit over dramatized And that s the only negative comment I have on this film It s sometimes too much too much sex too many murders and too much cynicism for one film The director could film some things a bit more subtle it would make the film more effective Despite this I liked the movie and the way the story unravels itself The characters are complex and very much like real life people Not pretty American actors and actresses with a lot of cosmetics but people who could be ugly and beautiful at the same time That makes the film realistic even when the story is not that convincing
0	I had the distinct displeasure of seeing this movie at the Vancouver International Film Festival I have been attending this festival for over years and I have certainly seen some poor movies on occasion However First Bite has reached a brand new low in film In spite of being shot in beautiful locations with the occasional exquisite close up of fabulous food the movie contorts an excessive number of plot twists and stilted characters until I was practically begging for it to end The lead actor David La Haye completely failed to show any character development throughout the movie portraying a pompous chef from beginning to end Additional sub plots such as eating disorders were developed so poorly and completely did not fit within any context that the movie had shown up to that point A theme of mysticism was used as a poor attempt to conceal a movie that achieves nothing goes nowhere and completely disappoints
1	This is a cute little horror spoof comedy featuring Cassandra Peterson aka Elvira Mistress of the Dark the most infamous horror hostess of all time This was meant to be the pilot vehicle for Elvira and was so successful that it was picked up by the NBC Network They filmed a pilot for a television series to feature the busty babe in black but unfortunately the sit com never made it past the pilot stage due to it s sexual references This film however is very amusing Elvira is the modern day Chesty Morgan and the queen of the one liners This film was followed up a few years later by the abysmal Elvira s Haunted Hills which was meant to be a take off of the old Roger Corman movies but falls flat on it s face Watch this movie instead for a much more entertaining experience
0	Made the unfortunate mistake of seeing this film in the Edinburgh film festival It was well shot from the outset but that s the last positive comment I have about the film The acting was awful I wonder if actual gogo girls were hired But it was the plot that was truly laughable in fact that it was laughable and not boring is the only reason I gave this Spoilers below I just want to mention a few of the scenes that really got the audience laughing Shoving the girl in the field who would have thought that a kid shoving another kid could be acted so badly A real eye opener The getting on the bus scene the girl is getting on the bus But according to the music the world is ending The rolling under the clothes line Wow this one really demonstrates the plot writer s skills In the room followed by raw meat and skill selling Why not just get her to perform all three sins at once At least then the film might have been slightly shorter The running down the stairs of the mall watch as one of the girls takes to flight down the stairs pursued by a flesh eating Dau no wait she is just walking quickly trying not to break her nails The running covered in blood this is definitely my favourite scene and a fitting end to the movie A half marathon in red paint completed by vaulting up stairs and over the bridge only to be sent flying most unrealistically by a passing car Not only this but this suicide is undertaken by the most self obsessed girl in the film now that s sticking to character for you I d like to think that this film was created by a year old and their mates Sadly having met the director at the presentation this is not the case But if you re in a sarcastic mood and fancy a laugh with a few mates then still don t even think about it
1	The Incredible Melting Man is a fantastically gross trashy and energetic Z grade production that every self respecting camp horror freak simply has to see for him herself The ideal way to describe this low budget s gem is like a shameless copy of Hammer s The Quatermass Xperiment only a thousand times filthier Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space mission but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and causes him to melt In shock after seeing his face in the mirror can you blame him Steve busts out of the hospital leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind Doctor Ted Nelson has to find him urgently as the disease also set Steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh The premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make up effects from the hand of Rick Baker The melting dude s face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader Another big advantage is that William Sachs screenplay doesn t waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches The repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film Just enjoy this silly horror gem and try to switch off your brain activity as much as you can because if you start contemplating about the many stupidities in the script you ll miss out on all the campy fun
1	The Korean War has been dubbed Americas s forgotten war So many unanswered questions were buried along with the thousand men who died there Occasionally we are treated to a play or movie which deals with that far off ghostly frozen graveyard Here is perhaps one of the finest It s called Sergeant Ryker The story is of an American soldier named Sgt Paul Ryker Lee Marvin who is selected for a top secret mission by his commanding officer His task is to defect to the North Koreans and offer his services against United Nations forces So successful is his cover he proves invaluable to the enemy and given the rank of Major However he is thereafter captured by the Americans put on trial as a traitor and spy Stating he was ordered to defect he sadly learns his commanding officer has been killed and has no evidence or proof of his innocence He is convicted and sentenced to hang However his conviction is doubted by Capt Young Bradford Dillman his prosecutor Convincing commanding Gen Amos Baily Lloyd Nolan of his doubts he is granted a new trial and if found guilty will be executed The courtroom drama is top notch as is the cast which includes Peter Graves Murray Hamilton and Norman Fell as Sgt Max Winkler Korea was a far off place but the possibility of convicting a Communist and hanging him hit very close to home in the s Due to its superior script and powerful message this drama has become a courtroom Classic Excellent viewing and recommended to all
0	This is the worst movie I have seen since I Know Who Killed Me with Lindsey Lohan After watching this movie I can assure you that nothing but frustration and disappointment await you should you choose to go see this Hey Tim Burton I used to be a big fan of yours did you even screen this movie I mean seriously what the f k Without giving anything away here is the story in a vague nutshell Nine wakes up he does stuff his actions and decisions are irrelevant and the movie ends Oh wait here comes a spoiler Spoiler alert Spoiler alert At the end of the movie it rains I think a part of my soul died while watching this movie
0	From the very opening scene you will notice just how hard they tried to mimic the very smart and powerful Cruel Intentions and how flat it landed You ll also notice what a terrible choice they made by casting Robin Dunne as Valmont Then in the second scene you meet the two best things in this movie Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother That is if you can get past the fact that Kathryn wasn t blonde in the first film Then the movie goes on you see the cheap romantic story from miles ago and you notice Sebastian has already met an Anette in the past here called Danielle and a Cecile here called Cherie How original is that for a prequel Then it turns into a low budget Wild Things type of film with lots and lots of oh my twists As I mentioned Robin Dunne was a very bad choice Not that he is a bad actor he s good He just doesn t have the charisma Ryan did Amy Adams who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses of our time once again delivers But with all the talent in the world there is no way one could save this trash As a whole this movie feels like a Beverly Hills episode The score has been stolen from Cruel Intentions and Jawbreaker Yes they used the score from JAWBREAKER Couldn t they at least leave that one alone You ll want to pass this one If you want more Cruel Intentions watch Stephen Frears Dangerous Liaisons
1	Rain or shine outside you enter a movie house It makes you happy If not come right out Lights go off You settle down with a bar of ice cream Moving pictures begin to flicker on the screen You feel content In the dark you are back in the beginning of time Sitting around the campfire looking at the modern version of the flickering flames times per second and sharing the joy of discovering the unknown turns and twists of the scenario with rest of your clan spectators Those who are not happy with themselves should not write comments Long live romantic comedies
1	The movie is just plain fun maybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of The Ramones around the time the film was made I ve watched the film over and over by myself and with friends and it is still fresh and funny At the risk of being too serious the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless and high school students boredom with drudgery of some classes is just as timeless And the film has some gem lines scenes references to how our permanent record in high school will follow us through life Let me assure you I ve been out of high school for uhhh some years and it s not following me the famous static line I m getting some static Not as much as you re going to get as Principal Togar approaches the school board member who is so decrepit he s attended by nurses the Nazi Hall Monitors love for a body search Principal Togar announcing I give you the final solution and burning the Ramones records note records were what came before CD s and of course Joey Ramone noting Things sure have changed since we got kicked out of high school followed by Togar asking Do your parents know you re Ramones Just one piece of advice don t look up where the stars are now Joey Ramone sadly died young Dey Young who was a major hottie in the film today reminds us we all age PJ Soles career never advanced as we might have expected Marla Rosenfield as one the other students apparently appeared only in this film one of my male friends dies over her every time we watch the film though I submit her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more teen film roles And does anyone know what happened to DJ Don Steele So watch and enjoy don t think just have FUN
1	Sam Fuller s excellent PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is the pick of the bunch from a number of early s Cold War influenced low budget noir vehicles With a running length of under minutes PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is tough gritty explosive and endlessly entertaining Widmark stars as pickpocket Skip McCoy who has already been picked up three times Yet McCoy can t keep his wandering fingers out of trouble and trouble is exactly what he slides into when he grifts the wallet of gangster s moll Candy Jean Peters Candy s wallet contains a roll of microfilm invaluable to the Communist movement and it s her last job for ex boyfriend Richard Kiley to make the delivery However when Widmark lifts it Peters must do whatever it takes to re claim the film she initially knows nothing about It s a tasty set up with Widmark s character while not the psycho of KISS OF DEATH a real live wire unpredictable and tough yet curiously charming When Bogart or Mitchum stepped into a film noir role you knew what you were going to get a lone anti hero maintaining his moral integrity and winning out in the end Bogart or an overly laconic guy who allows himself to be drawn into a trap Mitchum With Widmark you just don t know what you are going to get and with his incredibly modern acting style his films always hold up well he is amazing to watch Here he is torn between making a big score for himself by selling the film or handing it over to the police and fighting the Commies on the right side of the law And he still has to pretend he never pickpocketed Peters to avoid the fatal fourth rap on his sheet Peters gets her best role as the moll with a heart of gold Candy Widmark s unpredictability is perhaps best expressed in his scenes with Peters the gorgeous tramp quickly and rather unbelievably the romance angle is rather rushed falls under Widmark s spell yet Widmark alternates between kissing her or slapping her around Peters hard edged beauty yet lack of over lacquered Hollywood glamour Lana Turner would never have worked well in this role is a major asset to the film Candy is not innocent yet she s very vulnerable constantly being passed between and slapped around by men Widmark knocks her cold on first meeting and wakes her by pouring beer over her face yet by the final act he s a lot more tender to her after she cops one hell of a going over from Kiley The scene in the hospital with Peters and Widmark shouldn t work but it does Thelma Ritter is brilliant as stoolie Moe well deserving of her Oscar nomination Ritter s performance like everything else in the film is gritty real and heartbreakingly honest Her death scene is stunning Fuller s camera movements and location settings are particularly interesting Fuller loved a good close up and PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is full of uncomfortable cloistering tight shots that only enhance the tension of the plot Fuller isn t afraid to let the camera linger on a shot for longer than standard Old Hollywood really allowed yet stunningly pulls away from Ritter s death scene to give the audience maximum impact The urban locales and unusual confronting camera angles give PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET a bold uncompromisingly modern look
0	Hilariously obvious drama about a bunch of high school I think kids who enjoy non stop hip hop break dancing graffiti and trying to become a dj at the Roxy or something To be totally honest I was so bored I forgot Even people who love the music agree this movie is terribly acted and as a drama failed dismally We re supposed to find this kids likable and nice I found them bland and boring The one that I REALLY hated was Ramon He does graffiti on subway trains and this is looked upon as great Excuse me He s defacing public property that isn t his to begin with Also these great kids tap into the city s electricity so they can hold a big dance party at an abandoned building Uh huh So we re supposed to find a bunch of law breakers lovable and fun I could forgive all that if the music was good but I can t stand hip hop The songs were at best mediocre and they were nonstop They re ALWAYS playing It got to the point that I was fast forwarding through the many endless music numbers Cut out the music and you haver a minute movie maybe There are a few imaginative numbers the subway dance fight a truly funny Santa number and the climatic Roxy show If you love hip hop here s your movie But it you re looking for good drama mixed in forget it Also HOW did this get a PG rating There s an incredible amount of swearing in this
0	There was not one original idea in this story Themes were pulled from various sources a few being The Ninth Gate In the Mouth of Madness another Carpenter film and The Ring It even went as far as featuring the same damn glowing circle from The Ring and using it as the film s namesake The soundtrack by Cody Carpenter was all but lifted from Suspiria Hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spewing the word HOMAGE around Yes I saw that the theater was playing Argento s Deep Red Claiming an homage would be a bullshit cop out This was bottom of the barrel Throwing gore and disturbing imagery into the pot does not make a good horror film Carpenter used to know that He should fade into obscurity or acquire a time machine
0	You have to understand when Wargames was released in it created a generation of wannabe computer hackers The idea that a teenager could do anything of far reaching proportions let alone deter a world war was novel and thrilling Real computers were beginning to show up in people s homes and for the first time society was becoming interconnected in a way that made the movie s premise excitingly prescient Granted a talking computer that balanced it s free time between chess and global thermonuclear war was a bit far fetched but the brilliant commentary on nuclear proliferation and the cold war made up for it I ve probably even heard of the hackers that this movie was actually based on Fast forward years and we have a horrible mutant of a thing that I loathe to call a sequel called Wargames The Dead Code I ll just dig right in First of all the plot hinges on a government operated gambling site where folks who win the games automatically become terror suspects You re probably very confused right now The idea is that eventually the terrorist will click on the sub game within the web site called The Dead Code where they pilot a plane over a city spraying it with bioweapons At some point in the game you have to choose between sarin gas and anthrax and if you choose sarin then you re automatically confirmed as a bioterrorism weapons expert and your family is taken into custody and interrogated In the movie this actually happens However since the payment for the game was made from a bank account that was suspicious it obviously all makes sense Second the avatar of the AI in this straight to DVD bomb is an annoying flash animation that keeps repeating the pop up ad esquire sound bite play with me baby Because apparently in the future advanced AI loses interest in intellectual pursuits like chess and gets into porn Third the motivation for these hackers is profit and women as opposed to pure curiosity as in the original movie For some reason recent hacker movies feel the need to portray all young adults as average surfer dude kind of people who are just like everyone else That may work for your average sitcom but c mon you don t learn how to take over government computers by doing your hair playing sports and shopping at the mall folks The one novel thing I noticed was that at some point in the dialogue there is a reference to a Matt Damon movie and then later there is the phrase Good Hunting Will I swear they named the main character Will just for that phrase so they could send a high five to Mr Damon This Will kid isn t bad but he was certainly wasn t like any obsessive hacker I ve ever met I can t fully state how annoyed I am that this movie shares the same name as the original because it has absolutely nothing in common with it except Professor Falken and Joshua WOPR make a reappearance in this movie as a limp old man who apparently is dying of boredom and a dilapidated old tic tac toe machine with a higher pitched voice After some prodding Joshua the AI has what appears to be sex with the new AI with the porn voice a bunch of board games flash on the big screens and the whole The only way to win is not to play revelation is supposed to be the crowning moment Except that those of us who saw the original you know those who would want to see this in the first place have already been there and done that A recycled ending for a movie made from last month s compost The new movie was directed by a guy who s done and written by guys who do B movies The original was directed by a guy who s been keeping himself busy with Heroes so you see the quality difference there There was talk of a real remake but I hope they don t destroy this classic all over again I swear if I have to I ll visit every gambling web site until I find the one that s run by a psychotic government computer The saving grace is that I was able to stream this on Netflix so at least the only energy I expended watching this disaster was for breathing clicking and indigestion
1	I m Italian and when I ve recently looked again this film I astonished for its beauty the first time I was years old and I liked it but today I can appreciate it with adult mind and feelings Now I can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of the Italian cinema Pasolini etc by that time gone The Hollywood epic films are good for fun Perhaps this Odyssey had no English version because is not enough funny not suitable for pop corn and coke audience However suitable for Homer pathos and existentialist reflections In Italy was recently released a very good DVD version INTEGRAL with excellent colors You can find it in some file sharing but it s Italian only and without subtitles Too bad also the dialogs and the voices of this film are remarkable
1	CCCC is the first good film in Bollywood of When I first saw the trailer of the film I thought It would be a nice family movie I was right Salman Khan has given is strongest performance ever My family weren t too keen on him but after seeing this film my family are very impressed with him Rani and Preity are wonderful The film is going to be a huge hit because of the three main stars It s about Raj Salman Khan and Priya meeting and falling in love They get married and go to Switzerland for their honeymoon When they come back Raj and Priya find out that Priya is pregnant Raj s family are full of joy when they find out especially Raj s dada Amrish Puri Raj and his family are playing cricket one day and Priya has an accident which causes Priya to have a miscarriage Raj has a very close family friend who is a doctor Balraj Chopra Prem Chopra He tells Raj and Priya that she can no longer have anymore kids Raj and Priya keep this quiet from the family Raj and Priya decide to go for surrogacy Surrogacy to them is that they will find a girl and Raj and that girl will have a baby together and then hand the baby over to Raj and Priya Raj finds a girl Her name is Madhubala Preity Zinta She is a dancer and a prostitute Raj tells her the situation and bribes her with money and she agrees Raj changes Madhubala completley Raj tells Priya that he has found a girl Madhubala and Priya meet and become friends They go to Switzerland to do this so no one finds out Priya spends the night in a church and Raj and Madhubala are all alone and they spend the night together The doctor confirms that Madhubala is pregnant and they are all happy Raj tells his family that Priya is pregnant They are happy again Madhubala comes to love Raj and she wants him What happens next Watch CCCC to find out The one thing I didn t like about the film is their idea of surrogacy They should have done it the proper way in the film but it didn t ruin the film It was still excellent The songs of the film are great My favourites are Chori Chori Chupke Chupke Dekhne Walon Ne Deewana Hai Yeh Mann and Mehndi The song Mehndi is very colourful In that song it shows the ghod bharai taking place and it is very colourful The film deserves
1	The snobs and pseudo experts consider it a far cry from De Sica s best The ones suffering from a serious lack of innocence will find a problem connecting to this masterpiece De Sica spoke in a very direct way His Italianness doesn t have the convoluted self examination of modern Italian filmmakers or the bitter self parody of Pietro Germi the pungent bittersweetness of Mario Monicelli the solemnity of Visconti or the cold observation of Antonioni De Sica told us the stories like a father sitting at the edge of his children s bed before they went to sleep There is no attempt to intellectualize Miracolo A Milano and in a lesser degree Il Giudizio Universale are realistic fairy tales or what today we call magic realism The film is a gem from beginning to end and Toto is the sort of character that you accept with an open heart but that naturally requires for you to have a heart Cinema in its purest form Magnificent
1	Okay sorry but I loved this movie I just love the whole s genre of these kind of movies because you don t see many like this one anymore I want to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a rip off or a cheesy imitation what is it imitating I ve never seen another movie like this one well not horror anyway Basically its about the popular group in school who like to make everyones lives living hell so they decided to pick on this nerdy boy named Marty It turns fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little pranks So its like years later and the group of friends who hurt Marty start getting High School reunion letters But they are the only ones receiving them So they return back to the old school and one by one get knocked off by Yeah you probably know what happens The only part that disappointed me was the very end It could have been left off or thought out better I think you should give it a try and try not to be to critical CupidGrl
1	They All Laughed is a superb Peter Bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves and why their are many reasons the fact that it s set in new york which truly sets the tone the fantastic soundtrack the appealing star turns from Ben Gazzara and the late John Ritter who is superb and of course no classic is complete without Audrey Hepburn the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties film is essentially about the Odyssey detective agency which is run by Gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric Blaine Novak the films co producer and John Ritter basically the Gazzara falls for a rich tycoon magnate s wife Hepburn and Ritter falls for beautiful Dorothy Stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production They All Laughed is essential viewing for Bogdanovich fans
0	SPOILERS AHEADThis is one of the worst movies ever made it s that simple There is not one redeeming quality about this movie The first minutes are quite tricky they actually lead you to believe that this film will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat Instead you will spend minutes punching yourself while watching stolen and poorly made scenes run without any organization The lake was ridiculous looked like an aquarium and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed Characters show their advanced teleportation powers for example Alex Thomas who falls into the lake drunk and then ends up on his boat in an impossible position Angie Harmon put up a pitiful performance as Kate made worse by the space time continuum rupturing dialog that appears to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grader An example of this would be when she said Flashlight in such a stupid manner that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can cringe before it snaps in half Finally the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrific that I have ever seen It was like the cameramen were a bunch of chimps who had been given camcorders by scientists An example of this would be when we suddenly get a closeup of the headlight on Alex s car I would bet that there was little to no time spent editing this movie The ending was absolutely pathetic The writers were obviously trying to create some sort of mysterious plot line that made the viewer say oh yeah Instead we re left to view some dumb painting of a spider that somehow fits into the story line Unfortunately there is not one perspective in the millions out there that could save this movie from being a festering piece of crap I give this a out of the being from the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book
1	Todd Rohal is a mad genius Knuckleface Jones his third and most fully realized short film has an offbeat sense of humor and will leave some scratching their heads What the film is about at heart and he would almost certainly disagree with me on this is how a regular Joe finds the confidence to get through life with a little inspiration Or not You just have to see for yourself The short is intermittently making rounds on the festival circuit so keep your eyes peeled and catch it if you can you ll be glad you did It is hilarious And check out Todd s other short films also popping up here and there from time to time Single Spaced and Slug
0	Scary Movie is a let down to the Scary Movie Franchise Scary Movie and were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny Luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great Scary Movies This film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their Professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape This movie isn t horrible but they could have improved quite a few things It is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the Scary Movie franchise then give this a watch but I don t think you will like it nearly as much
1	Bertrand Blier is indeed l enfant terrible of French cinema and in the seventies he always could shock the public Filmed with his fave duo Depardieu and Dewaere and the usual dose of sex Miou Miou plays her typical role at least the one from the seventies as little could we know that a decade later she would be the best French actress ever In first Les Valseuses is also one of the first roadmovies as the viewer is just taken to some journeys of two little criminals Those who only are satisfied with family life or simply know nothing more the movie would be quite a shocker but this movie is more than just that it just let you think of all the usual things in life working for the car being bounded at work etc It s a sort of critic towards the hypocrite society we re living in Great job and it just makes you wish two things Dewaere died just too young as he was a topactor and of course Depardieu he d better should have stuck with French movies as he proves here that no one can beat him Timeless classic and years later it will still shock some
0	The Revolt of the Zombies is not the worst movie I ve ever seen but it is pretty far down on the list When an expedition is sent to Cambodia to discover the trick to making zombies after World War I one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions And he succeeds at least at first A love triangle complicates the story some This really was a tedious movie with horrible acting that made it difficult to tell who were zombies and who weren t The dialog was little better and the plot was unbelievable not the zombie part of it but parts related to the romance And while I am not any student or expert on cinematography the camera work didn t seem to help the film much either While I have seen a few movies that are worse this is unlikely to please anyone It s bad and NOT in a so bad that it is good kind of way
0	My comments on this movie have been deleted twice which i find pretty offending since i am making an effort to judge this movie for other people Please be tolerant of other people s opinion Obviously writing in the spirit of Nietzsches works is not understood so ill change my comment completely I think this is a really bad movie for several reasons Subject one should be very careful in making a movie about a philosopher that is even today not understood by the masses and amongst peers brings out passionate discussions One thing philosophers do agree on is that Nietzsche was a great thinker So making a movie about his life which obviously includes his ideas is a thing one should be extremely careful with or preferably don t do at all Wisdom starts with knowing what you don t know One might think this is not a review of the movie itself but the movie is not about an imaginary character it is about the life of someone who actually lived and had has great influence on the world of yesterday today and tomorrow If someone tells a story about a tomato i can express my thoughts about the story itself but also about the chosen subject the tomato There is a responsibility for producers when they make a movie about actual facts Specially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken Screenplay One of the first things i noticed were the ridiculous accents Why It distracts from what it should be about Nietzsche and the truths he found It doesn t help putting things in a right geographical perspective or time Come on make it proper English or better yet German Even Mel Gibson got that part right letting his characters speak some gibberish Aramaic in the Passion Secondly it is well over acted d Assante is not an actor to depict Nietzsche Bad casting th facts are way off And so on Its a waste of celluloid
1	After dipping his toes in the giallo pool with the masterful film The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh director Sergio Martino followed up that same year with what turns out to be another twisty suspense thriller The Case of the Scorpion s Tail Like his earlier effort this one stars handsome macho dude George Hilton who would go on to star in Martino s Satanic giallo hybrid All the Colors of the Dark the following year Scorpion s Tail also features the actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg who would go on to portray an unhappy couple to put it mildly in Martino s Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key I just love that title I suppose Edwige Fenech was busy the month they shot this Anyway this film boasts the stylish direction that Martino fans would expect as well as a twisty plot some finely done murder set pieces and beautiful Athenian location shooting The story this time concerns an insurance investigator Hilton and a journalist Strindberg here looking like Farrah Fawcett s prettier smarter sister who become embroiled in a series of grisly murders following a plane crash and the inheritance of million by a beautiful widow I really thought I had this picture figured out halfway through but I was dead wrong Although the plot does make perfect sense in this giallo I may have to watch the film again to fully appreciate all its subtleties Highlights of the picture for me were Anita s cat and mouse struggle with the killer at the end a particularly suspenseful house break in and a nifty fight atop a tiled roof lots of good action bursts in this movie The fine folks at No Shame are to be thanked for still another great looking DVD with nice subtitling and interesting extras Whotta great outfit it s turned out to be in its ongoing quest to bring these lost Italian gems back from oblivion
0	This movie features an o k score and a not bad performance by David Muir as Dr Hackenstein The beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the special effects that this is a low budget movie There is nothing in this movie that you could not find in other mad scientist horror comedy or low budget movies Not special for any nude scene buffs or bad movie lovers either This movie is simply here Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are nothing to get excited about as well If you are curious as I was and can actually find this you will realize the truth of the one line summary
0	I can t believe that this movie even made it to video and that video rental stores are willing to put it on their shelves I literary asked for a refund Take away the fact that the movie has no historical truth it and it is still the worse movie ever found in a video store It is not even good enough to be called a B rated movie Do not waste your money or your time on this movie Just listing to the voice over and the horrible music made me sick Anyone involved with this movie should be pulled from the union gives the industry a black mark but after watching most of this movie I really don t think anyone involved is a union member
1	The story of A Woman From Nowhere is rather simple and pretty much adapted right out of a Eastwood Spaghetti Western A mysterious stranger comes into a lawless town run by a kingpin and starts shooting up the place Even the opening credits and music have that spaghetti feel Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone would be proud The really interesting twists are that the stranger is a beautiful woman Saki Ryoko Yonekura on a Harley and the location is in a town somewhere in Japan In this actioner there s a considerable amount of gunplay some of it good some predictable and other spots somewhat hokey but it s a whole lot of fun Ryoko handles her guns with believability and aplomb and gives the thugs their due It wasn t much of an acting challenge for her as it was a physical challenge but she handled things very well She shows her acting skills much more as Otsu in the NHK drama Musashi I d highly recommend film if you re a Ryoko Yonekura fan which I adoringly am and or a girls with guns movie fan and it does hold up to repeated viewings To me there s something eminently and inexplicably appealing about girls with guns movies like La Femme Nikita and The Long Kiss Goodnight And to have a gorgeous gal like Ryoko starring in it as well is just gobs of icing on the cake
1	Verry classic plot but a verry fun horror movie for home movie party Really gore in the second part This movie proves that you can make something fun with a small budget I hope that the director will make another one
1	I have loved this movie since I first saw it in I m still amazed at how accurately Kurt Russell portrays Elvis right down to how he moves and the expressions on his face Sometimes its scary how much he looks acts and talks like the real Elvis Thankfully this is being released on DVD so all of us that have been waiting can finally have an excellent quality version of the full length film I have heard the detractors who say that there are some inaccuracies or some things left out but I think that keeping in mind that John Carpenter only had about hours to work with and that this was being shown on television just two years after Elvis s death that he did a fine job with this In fact I haven t seen another Elvis movie that even comes close to this one Highly recommended
0	This is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies Once again it doesn t make since The killer still kills for fun But this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie Which means that it is the stupidest movie ever Don t watch this If you value the one precious hour during this movie then don t watch it You ll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it Because it just doesn t combine the original makes of horror action and crime Don t let your children watch this Teenager young child or young adult this movie has that sorta impact upon people
1	Saw this my last day at the festival and was glad I stuck around that extra couple of days Poetic moving and most surprisingly funny in it s own strange way It s so rare to see directors working in this style who are able to find true strangeness and humor in a hyper realistic world without seeming precious or upsetting the balance Manages to seem both improvised yet completely controlled It I hesitate to make comparisons because these filmmakers have really digested their influences Cassavetes Malick Loach Altman the usual suspects and found their own unique style but if you like modern directors in this tradition Lynne Ramsay David Gordon Greene you re in for a real treat This is a wonderful film and I hope more people get to see it If this film plays in a festival in your city go go go
0	Roommates Sugar and Bobby Lee are abducted by menacing dudes while out shopping one day and taken back to a secluded island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited when they were ten years of age and that a fortune is located on All that just pretty much bookends a movie that is pretty much one long flashback about the girls first visit to the island and subsequent fight with a cannibalistic family This one is extremely horribly acted by everyone involved to the point that I started feeling bad for poor Hank Worden who truly deserved much MUCH better As much as I didn t like Barracuda that s on the same DVD I have to admit that this film makes that one look like Citizen Kane Eye Candy one pair of tits they might belong to Kirsten Baker My Grade F Dark Sky DVD Extras Vintage ads for various drive in food and Trailers for Bonnie s Kids features nudity the Centerfold Girls Part time Wife features nudity Psychic Killer Eaten Alive The DVD also comes with s Barracuda
0	A real disappointment from the great visual master Ridley Scott G I Jane tells the story of a first female ever to go through the hellish training at the Navy SEALs The training is the most difficult and hard in existence as the instructor says in the film to the lead character O Neil played by Demi Moore There is no particular message or point in this film or then I couldn t reach it properly It may be a some kind of a statement of female rights and abilities but it all sinks under the tired scenes and stupid gun fight at the end of the film I really can t understand why Ridley uses so much zooms in that mentioned last gun battle at the desert It looks sooooo stupid and irritating and almost amateurish so I would really like to know what the director saw in that technique When I look at his latest film Black Hawk Dawn there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scenes which are plenty and they are very intense and directed with skill The whole finale in G I Jane looks ugly and is nothing more but stupid and brainless shooting and killing This is Ridley Scott s worst movie in my opinion and there are no significant touches from which this great director is known Still I m glad I saw this in Widescreen format because there are still couple of great scenes and samples of Scott s abilities but they are very few in this film A disappointment and nothing compared to the classics Blade Runner Thelma Louise Alien and so on of this talented director So I m forced to give G I Jane
1	This is one of the great movies of the s in MY collection that I think about all the time The Running Man is one of Arnold s best and most different films even to this day and when I first saw The Running Man I was so excited to see a movie like this I just adore all of the fights and this is truly a special movie It also has Jesse Ventura the legendary Professor Toru Tanaka Sven Ole Thorsen the beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso Yaphet Kotto Kurt Fuller Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosales Jr who seems to always like death in his movies because he has been killed in such films as Universal Solder The Lost World Robo Cop Predator and among others All Arnold fans should love this film from the beginning to the end because its action packed star filled and its one its one of Arnold s best to date
1	This anime was underrated and still is Hardly the dorky kids movie as noted i still come back to this years after i first saw it One of the better movies released The animation while not perfect is good camera tricks give it a D feel and the story is still as good today even after i grew up and saw ground breakers like Neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon It has nowhere near the depth obviously but try to see it from a lighthearted view It s a story to entertain not to question Still one of my favourites I come back too when i feel like a giggle on over more lighthearted animes Not to say its a childish movies there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humour to see it all
1	I saw this little Belgian gem two days after seeing American Teen Make no mistake about it adolescence is a roller coaster ride be it American or European Naissance des Pieuvres or as it is being called in the U S Water Lillies is a tale of a young year old girl played by Pauline Acquart who at times resembles a young Scarlett Johansson acts the cool withdrawn girl who wants to be on the school swim team just to be close to another attractive girl Adele Haenel It s more than obvious that Marie is more than attracted to Floriane Figuring among all of this is Marie s rather plump unattractive friend Anne who just wants a boyfriend like any other girl her age Along the way we are shown the usual array of teen pastimes broken hearts shop lifting alcohol and or drug use casual sex etc This is a quiet little film that takes time to work it s way into your system Michael Bay fans take note the pacing here is s l o w so steer clear but if you have no problem with this Water Lillies is a charmer No rating here but would pull down a hard R due to language nudity adult situations
1	I ve bought certain films on disc even though the second rate presentation wasn t an option A certain company I won t identify here has put out several pan and scan dvds Clean and Sober Star and this one to name just three of films I don t think anyone wants to see in this compromised format Some discs give the viewer a choice of x or full screen and others are just in their theatrical release ratio That off my chest I ll say Deathtrap was a spooky and oddly enough amusing picture My only complaints are the tinny score what IS that f g instrument that is usually dragged out for films set in th century France and Dyan Cannon screaming at regular intervals Couldn t her character have been an asthmatic who grabbed for an inhaler when she was stressed Minor complaints both The benefits of discs include being able to fast forward to get beyond those things which you don t like I never saw a staged version of Deathtrap so having these folks in the roles sets a great impression of their careers at the time Before Broadway tickets cost an arm and a leg the theatre was more affordable to average people Now anyone paying less than a king s ransom to get live entertainment probably isn t going to a hit show on the great hyped way Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve were both large virile specimens in the early s and that s integral to how we ll react to their profession and overall image here They re definitely not bookish men who can t fight or will back down from an obstacle The two are equally great as their criminal stubbornness becomes their ultimate deathtrap
1	Channel is a channel that allows more naughty stuff than any of the other channels this show was certainly a naughty one The presenter of this sometimes gross adult chat show Four time BAFTA winning and British Comedy Award winning also twice nominated Graham Norton was just the perfect gay host for a good show like this It had one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it They basically had an adult idea which would either gross humiliate or humour the guest but some are not for the faint hearted They had women playing the recorder with their parts men using their dicks to play a xylophone women weeing upwards in the bath men with or without pants under their kilts and many more gross but hilarious ideas This is just for adults but enjoy it It won the BAFTA twice for Best Entertainment Programme or Series it won the British Comedy Awards for Best Comedy Entertainment Programme also nominated Best Comedy Talk Show it won an Emmy for episode and it won the National Television Awards twice for Most Popular Talk Show It was number on The Greatest Funny Moments Very good
1	I often wonder why this series was slammed so much I thought it was brilliant and also very cleverly written and performed I think in time to come it will be seen in the light it deserves that is if they ever issue it Many up and coming young comedy actors appeared in this and all went on to greater things Maybe this fact will make people aware of its value and it will have to be issued Sally Phillips Simon Pegg Peter Serafinowicz and not least Julian Rhind Tutt of the hugely successful Green Wing The writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are two of the finest comedy writers of the modern age Anyone that can produce comedy like Father Ted couldn t be capable of writing something not worthy of publication If it is ever issued I will certainly buy it
0	Van Dien must cringe with embarrassment at the memory of this ludicrously poor film as indeed must every single individual involved To be honest I am rather embarrassed to admit I watched it from start to finish Production values are somewhere between the original series of Crossroads and Prisoner Cell Block H Most five year olds would be able to come up with more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot As for the acting performances if you can imagine the most rubbish porno you have ever seen one of those ones where the action is padded out with some interminable story to explain how some pouting old peroxide blonde boiler has come to be getting spit roasted by a couple of blokes with moustaches you will have some idea of the standard of acting in Maiden Voyage Worse still you can t even fast forward to the sex scenes because there aren t any An appallingly dreadful film
1	Ah Domino is actually a breath of fresh air something new to the cinema world I enjoyed the movie a lot because of the intricate plot the varied characters and the intense camera effects I ve seen some complain about the camera work and in fact according to the creators themselves the flashy and wild shots were all the culmination of mistakes made through time All of what you see was the desired effect Perhaps some complain because something quite like this has never been done before although that s what sets it apart In a deeper aspect what you are seeing is just how Domino sees things through her eyes think about it When it comes to the story I don t see anything quite bad about it Despite it s messy nature according to some it is in fact just a rapid form of storytelling The plot really isn t all that hard to follow if you actually focus on what s going on Maybe it s just me because I see movies from many different aspects such as the acting the plot etc I m no interpreter or anything who picks movies apart it just comes to me With that said I believe this is quite an excellent movie indeed despite it s future as a cult classic blockbuster or whatever And the characters well there s no doubting how varied the cast is I believe the cast is excellent as they all do fine jobs portraying their characters effectively that s what makes a movie ladies and gentlemen The characters are all very unique and a plus is that you get to witness a small piece of each one of their lives setting them apart even further Basically I personally loved the cast and characters All those who bash and burn this film perhaps just don t see it as I do or it just doesn t appeal to them No matter this is a great film in it s own right no it s a great film period
0	Knowing how old a film is ought to prepare the viewer for a few things and with those things in mind perhaps the movie ll be more tolerable So it was when I watched Revolt of the Zombies The heavy reliance on tedious dialogue and corny movements should be expected as should the primitiveness or absence of special effects in those days A great deal is asked from the imagination of the onlooker maybe too much in this case And the plot isn t easy to follow Some zombiefied southeast Asian soldiers in WWI performed very admirably Although skeptical as to why if true the explanation should stay out of the wrong hands so off goes a group to archaeologically investigate The key to long distance hypnosis is learned by a member of the expedition who uses it to among other purposes temporarily dispense with the beau of the gal for whom he has the hots To prove his love for her he gives up his hold on everybody which he shouldn t have done cause once they re all unzombiefied many want to kill him so that he ll never control them again Below average even with precautionary forethought Recommended for only the extremely patient
1	This movie is still an all time favorite Only a pretentious humorless moron would not enjoy this wonderful film This movie feels like a slice of warm apple pie topped with french vanilla ice cream I think this is Cher s best work ever and her most believable performance Cher has always been blessed with charisma good looks and an enviably thin figure Whether you like her singing or not who else sounds like Cher Cher has definitely made her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have come and gone She is one of the most unique artists out there It s funny because who would have thought of Cher as such a naturally gifted actress She is heads above the so called movie stars of today Cher is a real actor on the same level as Debra Winger Alfre Woodard Holly Hunter Angela Bassett and a few others in that she never seems to be acting she really becomes the character convincingly She has more than earned the respect of her peers and of the movie going public Everything about Moonstruck is wonderful the characters the scenery the dialog the food I never get tired of watching this movie Every time single time I watch the scene where they are all sitting around the dinner table at Rose s house I pause the remote to see exactly what delicious food Rose is serving I saw the spaghetti mushrooms I think but I can t make out whether they are eating ravioli ziti What is that main course It looks wonderful and its driving me nuts Everybody in that family was a hardworking individual and they respected and cared about one another The grandfather wasn t pushed aside and tolerated he was a vital part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom He seemed to be a pretty healthy independent old codger too Loretta s mom wasn t just a housewife she was the glue that held the family together and was a model example of what a wife mother and home manager should aspire to be She was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen but she didn t let it define who she was High powered businessmen aren t as comfortable in their skin as Rose Casterini was Notice the saucy way she said I didn t have kids until after I was It ain t over til its over You got the sense that she had been the type of young woman who did exactly as she pleased and got her way without the other person realizing what had happened She was charming quick witted and very smart What a great mom I didn t actually like Loretta right away because she seemed like a bit of a know it all who wasn t really as adventurous and as in control of herself as she wanted others to think She could tell others about themselves and where they had gone wrong but she really didn t apply common sense to her own life She was going to marry a middle aged mama s boy simply because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose to her life She was more conventional than her own mom She dressed and wore her hair like a matron at a house of detention and seemed humorless and bored but underneath you sensed that she was vulnerable and lonely and had a lot of love to give the right man She would probably end up making an awesome mom too I could see in the future a house full of Loretta and Ronnie s loud screaming happy kids and Rose and Cosmo enjoying every minute of it
0	This is a classic stinker with a big named cast mostly seniors who were well past their prime and bedtime in this one This is quite a depressing film when you think about it Remain on earth and you will face illness and eventually your demise Gwen Verndon showed that she could still dance Too bad the movie didn t concentrate more on that Maureen Stapleton looking haggard still displayed those steps from Queen of the Star Dust Ballroom so much more down to earth from years earlier I only hope that this film doesn t encourage seniors to commit mass suicide on the level of Jim Jones How can anyone be idiotic enough to like this and say it gets you to think Why did Don Ameche win an Oscar for this nonsense If the seniors were doing such a wonderful thing at the end why was the youngster encouraged to get off the boat Why did Steve Guttenberg jump ship as well After all he had found his lady love This would have been a nice film if the seniors had just managed to find their fountain of youth on earth and stay there Sadly with the exception of Wilford Brimley at this writing Vernon Gilford Stapleton Ameche Tandy Cronyn and lord knows who else are all gone The writers should have taken the screenplay and placed it with this group as well
1	You ll notice by the stars I ve given this GREAT film that before you see it the first time is implied I had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week and last was a very slow rental experience not much great coming in I m not sure how this movie slipped past me I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is great too Still it did This movie is an awesome example of what to do if you don t have a large budget It had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark just enough The entire film is you the viewer trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns I would have given this film however some of the shots were pretty fake looking I don t hold that against this film too much but I don t think it deserves a perfect score Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious as always I think she s pretty underrated as a serious talent Nevermind her beauty which is difficult she really takes her roles seriously and doesn t rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion And she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed as well Jeremy Northam does really well at first as quite a geeky corporate rat willing to run through any maze to prove himself However as he changes throughout the film it s like night and day I know some fans of Clive Owen Jude Law or other hopefuls to become the next James Bond will hate me for this but Northam would could should fit that bill He s suave and cultured He s got a great Bond posture and voice I think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it and rather down to Earth as well Great film and definitely this movie buff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films
1	This movie shows life in northern Cameroon from the perspective of a young French girl France Dalens whose father is an official for the colonial French government and whose family is one of the few white families around It gives a sense of what life was like both for the colonists and for the natives with whom they associated It s a sense consistent with another movie I ve seen about Africa in a similar time period Nirgendwo in Afrika but I have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is It s not just an impression things do happen in the movie but the plot is understated The viewer is left to draw his own conclusions rather than having the filmmakers forced upon him although the framing of the story as a flashback from the woman s visit to south western Cameroon as an adult provides some perspective
1	Eva Hedy Lamarr has just got married with an older man and in the honeymoon she realizes that her husband does not desire her Her disappointment with the marriage and the privation of love makes Eva returning to her father s home in a farm leaving her husband One afternoon while bathing in a lake her horse escapes with her clothes and an young worker retrieves and gives them back to Eva They fall in love for each other and become lovers Later her husband misses her and tries to have Eva back home Eva refuses and fortune leads the trio to the same place ending the affair in a tragic way I have just watched Extase for the first time and the first remark I have is relative to the horrible quality of the VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Video Network the movie has only minutes running time and it seems that it was used different reels of film There are some parts totally damaged and other parts very damaged Therefore the beauty of the images in not achieved by the Brazilian viewer if he has a chance to find this rare VHS in a rental or for sale The film is practically a silent movie the story is very dated and has only a few lines Consequently the characters are badly developed However this movie is also very daring with the exposure of Hedy Lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric used of flowers symbolizing the intercourse between Eva and her lover The way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and privation of Eva is very clear The non conclusive end is also very unusual for a movie I liked this movie but I hope one day have a chance to see a minutes restored version My vote is eight Title Brazil xtase Ecstasy
0	If you didn t know better you would believe the Christian moral majority in their preachy testimonial of the sins of the young their questing for Satan and that Hell was just brimming with Advanced Dungeons and Dragons fans None of these items bears one grain of truth folks This work does nothing but give the Southern Baptists a chance to take a breath while the movie continues to spout their erroneous and alarmist views concerning a creative and original gaming system Tom Hanks contributes a stellar performance for this work but even that wasn t enough to save it It s crap It s beneath crap It is ignorance breeding ignorance and as such it rates NOTHING from the Fiend
0	I feel like I ve been had the con is on don t fall for it After reading glowing reviews the Director was a film reviewer with Sky for years so must have a lot of mates in the press ready to do him a favour by writing favorable reviews I expected solid acting atmosphere suspense strong characterization an intriguing plot development and poetic moments Sadly Sixteen years of Alcohol doesn t deliver on the critics promises for the most part sacrifices these qualities in lieu of cheesy low budget special effects what was that clich d cobweb scene in there for unrealistic fight choreography and mindless mind numbing narration clich edits and camera angles Sixteen years of Alcohol starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in Scotland but it s straight downhill from here Unfortunately instead of spending some time building atmosphere creating characters we might care about or building suspense the director opts to begin driving you crazy with self indulgent heavy handed twaddle voice over s The lead characters are so unsympathetic and are so badly acted the audience doesn t care what happens to them desperate Actors do desperate things like this movie To make matters worse the homage s typical of a director trying to pay his dues to past masters are either utterly clich or unconvincing The soundtrack is the only thing that lifted me and kept me in the cinema but even that failed to support the dramatic narrative other connecting a period of time to the action For some reason the movie got increasingly flawed and to be quite honest annoying I still watched the whole damn thing I guess I liked the attempt at gritty realism in the film but even that was destroyed when they were often inter cut with weird and abstract sometimes pointless scenes You don t need a huge budget to make truly moving film so much has been said about how little money they had to make this film half a million is not a little bit of money SO NO EXCUSES Sometimes I wonder what the actors Or their agents were thinking Pass on this turkey unless you re masochistic or mindless anyway NOT MY THING
0	except for Jon Heder This guy tanked the entire movie The plot sounded entertaining A year old slacker son Heder still lives with widowed mom Keaton who happens to meet a new love Daniels Slacker son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship He also meets a girl Faris I really liked the performance of Daniels and especially Faris but whoever casted Hader would be better of selling hot dogs at the beach Heders performance is annoying which would be a good thing since he plays an annoying guy problem is he is to bad an actor to loose this act making this guy likable in the finale At the end you still wish you can personally punch the guy in the face and you re upset about the end In the future every movie with this guy will be a no go for me
1	As the first of the TV specials offered on the elaborate box set Barbra Streisand The Television Specials released last November this disc is being released separately for those who do not want to fork over the dollars for all five specials As an investment this is indeed the best of the bunch if only for the fact that this is Streisand at her purest and most eager to impress That she succeeds so brilliantly is a key component of her legend Signed to a long term contract with CBS to produce hour long variety shows an almost extinct format nowadays Streisand was all of in this CBS special first broadcast in April At that point of her career her notoriety was limited to a handful of best selling albums a few dazzling TV appearances on variety and talk shows and her successful Broadway run in Funny Girl Filmed in crisp black and white the program is divided into three distinct parts With the creative transitional use of I m Late from Disney s Alice in Wonderland the first segment cleverly shows her growing up from childhood through numbers as diverse as Make Believe and I m Five Opening with a comic monologue about Pearl from Istanbul the second part moves on location to Manhattan s chic Bergdorf Goodman s where she is elegantly costumed in a series of glamorous outfits while singing Depression era songs like I ve Got Plenty of Nuthin and The Best Things in Life Are Free with comic irony Back to basics the third segment is a straight ahead concert which opens with a torchy version of When the Sun Comes Out includes a Funny Girl medley and ends with her classic melancholic take on Happy Days Are Here Again over the ending credits Also included is the brief introduction she taped in when the special was first released on VHS For those who know Streisand only for her pricey concert tickets and political fundraising this is a genuine eye opener into why she is so revered now
1	I am curious of what rifle Beckett was using in the movie and also the caliber of the bullet that he was suppose to be firing If this is loosely based on Carlos Hathcock s sniping I am guessing that it is a mm round I am also curious of the rifle itself He also made a comment in the final Sniper movie about the rifle that the Vietnamese man let him use that belonged to his father Beckett mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made I would like to know which rifle that is also I know that this particular rifle was made around WWII or beforehand I just couldn t get a close enough look at it watching the movie to identify it As for Mr Hathcocks kills his longest shot was miles and he had confirmed kills and unconfirmed kills After his wounds somewhat healed from being burned in Vietnam he spent the rest of his career teaching snipers in the USMC the skills that they would need in the field His sniping career is still mentioned to our brothers and sisters that train in the USMC I found out his name from my friend who is a former Marine Any information would be great
0	What a long drawn out pointless movie I m sure that historically this film is delightful but as entertainment goes it just doesn t make the grade Ralph Fiennes has been in some fantastic movies the English Patient Schindler s List but this one was such a let down It didn t seem to be going anywhere his character at the beginning was so shallow and uptight it amazes me that his sister would ever have been interested at all Don t bother paying to rent this movie buy yourself a copy of the English Patient instead
0	Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade I haven t seen it since I just watched the trailer though Does this look like a first grade movie to you I don t think so I was so horrified by this movie I could barely watch it It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half and then there was the boy with ketchup I was freaked out by this film Now today being I probably would not feel that way I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn t see this movie even though it s PG Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids I don t even remember what it was about once was enough
0	Human pot roast Joe Don Baker MITCHELL stars in this dull unremarkable action movie as Deputy Geronimo a fat gassy slob who sits around in a stupid looking cowboy suit listening to country music and eating too many donuts Meanwhile a vaguely criminal guy named Palermo played by the guy who owned the drill in Fulci s GATES OF HELL stumbles into Joe Don s territory and shoots the sheriff in a poorly edited scene Joe Don slowly gives chase and offs Palermo s brother after uttering his now legendary catch phrase It s your move Think you can take me Well go ahead on For some reason Joe Don a Texas lawman must transport Palermo to Italy Mr Palermo s been a major source of embarrassment to the Italian government says Mr Wilson another vague character played by Bill McKinney who was in MASTER NINJA SHE FREAK and a lot of good Clint Eastwood movies Anyhoo Joe Don s plane must land on the island of Malta where Palermo escapes with the help of a briefcase and a guy who looks like Jon Lovitz And that s where the movie grinds to a halt For the rest of the movie Joe Don looks for Palermo looses Palermo ends up in a jail cell is yelled at by the Malta chief of police and then is let go with a warning not to look for Palermo any more Then Joe Don keeps looking for Palermo looses Palermo ends up in a jail cell is yelled at by the Malta chief of police and then is let go with a warning not to look for Palermo any more Then Joe Don looks for Palermo looses Palermo ends up in a jail cell is yelled at by the Malta chief of police and then is let go with a warning not to look for Palermo any more This is one aggravating movie At one point Joe Don is thought to be dead at sea All the other characters wonder if he s dead or not finally concluding that he is But then he shows up he was rescued by a poor family and no one mentions the fact that he was missing at sea for several days Even his cute Julia Louise Dreyfuss esque sidekick doesn t welcome him back She does however offer to help him find Palermo so Joe Don looks for Palermo looses Palermo ends up in a jail cell is yelled at by the Malta chief of police and then let go with a warning not to look for Palermo any more Highpoints include a bizarre carnival with strange colorful floats some sexy strippers a shoot out involving a kid dressed like Napoleon AND a cart of tomatoes a chase scene involving a guy dressed like a monk and any scene without Joe Don Lowpoints include Joe Don threatening a stripper with a coat hanger It should be noted that this is from Greydon Clark director of ANGEL S REVENGE who appears as the sheriff Ick
0	Gadar is a really dumb movie because it tells a fake story It s too unrealistic and is a typical sunny deol movie that is aimed to bash Pakistan The movie s aim is to misguide the viewers so they can think that Pakistan and it s government is bad but trying to hide their own flaws won t work And all the songs and music of the movie are all bad Most likely the Sikhs will love th movie cause they are being misguided The movie sucks and sucks with power I think only Amisha Patel was good in the movie If i can give out of I would but the lowest is Please save hours of your life and do not watch this stupid boring movie Disaster
1	If you want Scream or anything like the big studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don t bother This well written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say Importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense how children interpret the world and the violence in it our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends all here but not flatly on the surface You could technically call it a monster movie even though the Wendigo does not take physical form until the end and then it s even up to you and your beliefs as to what s happening with the legendary spirit beast Some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores though in fact the less you see of the creature the better Fessenden successfully continues George Romero s tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out
0	In case half of this film s footage looks strangely familiar it means you watch way too much of this gory Italian cult crap For you see the notorious demigod Lucio Fulci did not only produce this movie he also took the liberty of re using the most sadistic killing sequences in his own and more easily traceable Cat in the Brain The opening scene already in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe features in Fulci s later film and so do another handful of killings and sleaze moments Andrea Bianchi s Masssacre fails miserably as a giallo since the search for the sadistic killer among a movie crew shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and suspenseful but it s still good entertainment if you re into cheap n shlocky horror trash The incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of repugnant characters who re all potential maniacs but none of the red herrings Biachi comes up with are plausible and you can point out the killer almost immediately Whatever remains to enjoy are the truly misogynous make up effects and the hilariously awful acting performances of the ensemble cast Whenever there isn t any bloodshed on screen like between the first and second murder Massacre is a slow and almost intolerable with its inane dialogs and thoroughly unexciting photography Thankfully in the second half there are women getting impaled on fences and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes The music is crap and the use of filming locations is very unimaginative My advise would be to skip this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned Cat in the Brain That one features ALL the great moments of Massacre and then some
0	Well if you like pop punk punk ska and a tad bit of modern psycho billy then seeing the live performances are about the only thing worth watching This movie has tons and tons of band cameos along with president of Troma Lloyd Kaufman as a semi major role and lots of goofy death scenes Sounds like it may be good right Well the deaths keep coming and repeatedly to many different bands of the Warp Tour and the fans at the event Some of the deaths start of stylish but then they are recycled over and over to the point of being completely repetitive Almost everyone dies of having their head smashed or intestines being pulled from their stomach The gore looks as if it was from Andreas Schnaas Zombie Extreme Pestilence with this being the watered down type blood but now that movie is actually decent and provides humor something that this movie terribly lacks Sure the movie is made by Doug Sakmann from Troma it s got great low budget potential and it tries but just too hard Everything is overly meant to be funny in this movie and thats what brings it down Everything tries to be too comic and goofy by using intentional bad acting an overuse of pointless deaths and doing the same thing over and over It s basically Mulva Zombie Ass Kicker Chairman of the Board or any movie you have made with your friends it s funny to those who made it and that s about it Great potential great idea great use of effects but it s the same thing over and over A band plays a band dies fans die Everyone dies blood is sprayed everywhere the process is repeated The question is for these types of movies which is basically bad slap stick do they try too hard or not at all
0	This movie is BAD It s basically an overdone copy of Michael Jackson s Thriller video only worse The special effects consist of lots of glow in the dark paint freaky slapstick fastmoving camera shots and lots of growling I think the dog was the best actor in the whole movie
1	Presenting Lily Mars MGM is a cute film but in my opinion it could have been better Judy Garland is great as always but some scenes in the film seem out of place and the romance between her and Van Heflin develops all too quickly I mean one minute he s ready to beat her butt but the next minute he falls in love with her I believe that this production the film editing and the script even though the photography was great the scenery was nice and the costumes were nice as well could have been a little better It feels as though the production was too rushed The supporting cast was good as well especially little Janet Chapman as the second youngest daughter daughter Rosie She at the age of looks really cute and it s a shame that she didn t develop into a teenage comic actress She s much better in this film than in her previous films as Warner Brothers in the late s except for Broadway Musketeers she s really good in that when they tried to make her into a Shirley Temple Sybil Jason hybrid Overall this film could better but in the end Judy gave it her all
0	Yep lots of shouting screaming cheering arguing celebrating fist clinching high fiving fighting You have a general idea as to why but can never be certain A naval knowledge would be an advantage for the finer points but then you d probably spot the many flaws Not an awful film Hackman Washington are their usual brilliant but the plot was one you could peg pretty early on I m still waiting to see a submarine film where people get on with each other don t argue but then you probably wouldn t have a film
1	I have seen the movie Holes and say that it has to be the best movie all year long It brings out the child in everyone I mean who would come up with the idea of having troublesome boys dig holes as their punishment Louis Sachar thats who Although the movie was different from the book it was still very good For example Caveman Stanley was supposed to be the biggest one there Weight wise and height wise but ZigZag Ricky was taller and Armpit Theodore was bigger Also X Ray Rex was supposed to be one of the smallest boys but wasn t The only thing that I didn t like about the movie was that the flashbacks were rather persuasive and long I would have rather seen more of the present than past but thats just my opinion I especially like the work of the boys though Like Squid Alan who was played by Jake M Smith was supposed to be a moody and tough kid Jake M Smith performed just that and did a great job at it as did almost all of the actors in Holes So I would say if you havent seen Holes yet then you should definatly see it when it comes out again or you ll be missing out on a whole lotta fun
1	I only watched this because it starred Josie Lawrence who I knewfrom Whose Line is it Anyway the wacky British improvisationalcomedy show I was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem It is uplifting touching andromantic without being sappy or sentimental The characters areall real people with real foibles fears and needs See it
1	slight spoilers Way back before Evangelion was made before Hideaki Anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans and before Gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite Gunbuster was made With only Wings of Honneamise made by Gainax at that time and the famous Otakon shorts or course Gunbuster had some tough acts to follow up It didn t make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before space opera Luckily Gainax decided to put it out as a six part OAV direct to video series This allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film This also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way Besides that they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in Macross or Gundam and many other popular space operas For one the shows starts out pretty light with Noriko in the Okinawa High School for mechapiloting Noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle when she was still a little kid This makes her life at the academy quite hard as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that Noriko is favored by the professors The first episode is pretty much a comedy drama with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school Things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced and Noriko and Kazumi best girl in class are chosen to help the assembled fleet out The middle bulk of Gunbuster leaves our female lead in space focusing on both personal drama and action A couple more characters are introduced and parts of Noriko s past are dragged up again Besides that the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute and the Gunbuster mankind s final hope is presented Smart as writer Okada was he incorporated the principles of time dilation to spice things up a bit In short time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light This means that Noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete Also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated when Noriko sees her friends again on her return to base who have aged considerably more than her The science might not be perfect but it s presented in a pretty believable way with even some SD science theatre shorts in between the episodes where Noriko Kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the series The animation for a series made in the s is definitely good The designs are retro s style of course but it has it s charm Animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice although the costumes do betraysome of the fanservice fascination Gainax will later exploit to the fullest The mechas throughout the shows are pretty cool too with the Gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine strong and vast The last episode was entirely done in black and white While it s generally believed but not confirmed that this was done for budget reasons it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series which is suited perfectly for the latter part The music is very typical space opera fair Too bombastic in places very generic and definitely not worth buying It does fit the series for the most part but it can become quite annoying at times Tanaka is not really a famous composer and the only other respectable series he s worked on is Dragon Half If you think s anime music you will know what to expect As the series progresses the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this Step by step the drama will be toned down and the battles will take the front row Neither aspect is ever left completely out though With the last episode in sight Noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind and with the last battle in sight certain questions are presented to the audience concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy and how far it can go to guarantee self preservation While they are never answered later on they still present some interesting food for thought The last episode is very epic with a nice but quite predictable ending though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course Again it fits the series Gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first with alien invasions huge battles and some personal drama and for the bigger part it is But it is done exceptionally well for a change Instead of going for a steady mix of former elements six episodes long Gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism Along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshed out characters which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon The show is very tightly written although it does tend to slip up at some points Overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided Overall the trip Gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed sometimes sad sometimes heroic one It might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre but at least it bend them a little Highly enjoyable anime classic but not without flaws
0	I m not going to approach and critique the theories of RAW I mean this is a site about movies and whether the movie delivers or is well made and not a site debating philosophy Having said that this video really blows It s one talking head shot of RAW after another Some of it is archival video so you can see how he has aged over the years and that s pretty cool But otherwise the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonous It s a strange comparison but I kept thinking of the Sunday afternoon when I watched some of the Barbra Streisand star vehicle Funny Lady another really bad movie After a while I was so OD d on Barbra I kept wishing there would be one scene that she wouldn t appear in you know a meanwhile other characters in the movie were up to something else moment But it was all about Barbra Well this video is RAW s Funny Lady So if your idea of a good time is to look at multiple takes and angles of the face of RAW while he prattles on with his theories assembled in a lame structure that doesn t add any interest or insight then be my guest For me I couldn t take it after minutes
0	This Drummond entry is lacking in continuity Most of them have their elements of silliness the postponed wedding and so on However this has an endless series of events occurring in near darkness as the characters run from one place to another The house seems more like a city There s also Leo G Carrol who is such an obvious suspect who no one seems to even look at He is a stranger and acts rather suspicious but Drummond and the folks don t seem to pick up on anything Still it as reasonably good action and a pretty good ending I know that Algie is supposed to be a comic figure but like Nigel Bruce in the Rathbone Sherlock Holmes flicks he is so buffoonish that it s hard to imagine anyone with taste or intelligence being around him Is there a history behind him that will explain how he and Drummond became associates
0	A woman s nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive The cheating husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of her phobia by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement Of course B horror movie queen Brinke Stevens transforms into hideous ghostly creature The only reason to see this amateurish junk flick is Michael Berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard And the last twenty minutes of Brinke s bloody rampage are quite fun to watch The special effects for example laughable decapitated head are truly awful Better watch Scalps or Alien Dead again Of course I ain t expecting classy entertainment from Fred Olen Ray but Haunting Fear is too dull to be enjoyable
0	As far as I am concerned this silent version of The Merry Widow is the worst version ever made There is no tenderness or love or spirituality about this version it is all macabre Germanic sinister nonsense It reminded me of Nazis falling in love who cares This silent version by von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story In this one we have leering John Gilbert and his gross relative the Prince lusting after this silly American actress played by Mae Murray possessed with a modern permed hairstyle and implausible feminist manner that threw me off again and again I like my romances light and beautiful with slow build ups not harsh and sadistic like this one And come on those bee stung lips get rid of them girl Go see a live performance of the show if you would like to get a real idea of the sweetness of the original operetta by Franz Lehar Failing that wait till TCM shows the Jeanette MacDonald Maurice Chevalier sound version It s much better
0	This movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a flop Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to make this a remake of classic bollywood movie Sholay but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and i guess leave all the good parts of the movie acting script songs music comedy action etc out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew Waste of money waste of time After making movies like Rangeela Satya and Company he pulled a Coppola Godfather on us What were you thinking RGV Anyways the story is though hard to follow is almost like the Old sholay Ajay Devgan playing Heero Beeru sholay and Ajay new kid on the block playing Ajay Jay sholay Both bad yet funny friends help a cop capture a bad guy first Later in the movie now Retired cop hires them as personal security and safeguarding from the hands of a very most wanted Bubban played by Amitabh Bachan In case you haven t been watching Bollywood movies the Good guys win in the end There I just saved you precious hours of your life
1	In what is a truly diverse cast this show hits it s stride on FOX It is the kind of sitcom that grows on you If you just watch show you might not like it much but once you watch two or three you get hooked This is because some of the jokes hit some miss depending upon how you view them As is usual today the themes are very mature The humor is usually very mature too Often the most funny parts are the parts where the mature themes collide with the innocent ones Red Kurtwood Smith a veteran actor does some very good deadpan type of humor on this show Debra Jo Rupp plays well in this ensemble cast too Danny Masterson the oldest actor of the kids is very good too Laura Prepon Donna looks better in the earlier shows as a natural redhead who got the idea of making her a blonde She shows very good talent comedic timing often She looks good without make up too This is one of the better entries on FOX in the sitcom department it s most successful live action one since Married With Children
1	John Schlesinger s Midnight Cowboy is perhaps most notable for being the only X rated film in Academy history to receive the Oscar for Best Picture This was certainly how I first came to hear of it and to be completely honest I didn t really expect much of the film This is not to say that I thought it would be horrible but somehow I didn t consider it the sort of movie that I would enjoy watching This is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners a remarkable combination of stellar acting ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack Everybody s talking at me I don t hear a word they re sayin make this film one of the finest explorations of life naivety and friendship ever released Young Joe Buck then newcomer Jon Voight dressed proudly as a rodeo cowboy travels from Texas to New York to seek a new life as a hustler a male prostitute Women however do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services and Joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up During these exploits Joe comes to meet Enrico Ratso Rizzo Dustin Hoffman a sickly crippled swindler who initially tries to con Joe out of all his money When they come to realise that they are both in the same predicament Ratso offers Joe a place to stay and working together they attempt to make largely dishonest lives for themselves in the cold gritty metropolis of New York Joe had convinced himself that New York women would be more than willing to pay for sex however his first such business venture ends with him guiltily paying the woman Sylvia Miles twenty dollars Though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent Ratso is just as na ve as Joe Ratso with his painful limp and hacking cough is always assuring himself that if only he could travel to the warmth of Miami somehow everything would be all right This misguided expectation that things will get better so easily is quite reminiscent of Lennie and George of John Steinbeck s classic novel Of Mice and Men Shot largely on the streets of New York Midnight Cowboy is a grittily realistic look at life in the slums Watching the film we can almost feel ourselves inside Ratso s squalid unheated residence our joints stiff from the aching winter cold The acting certainly contributes to this ultra realism with both Voight and Hoffman masterfully portraying the two decadent dregs of modern society Hoffman in particular is exceptional in his role I m walkin here I m walkin here managing to steer well clear of being typecast after his much lauded debut in s The Graduate Both stars were later nominated for Best Actor Oscars also nominated for acting bafflingly was Sylvia Miles for an appearance that can t have been for more than five minutes though both ultimately lost out to John Wayne in True Grit Midnight Cowboy eventually went on to win three Oscars from seven nominations including Best Picture Best Director for Schlesinger and Best Writing for Waldo Salt Midnight Cowboy is told mainly in a linear fashion though there are numerous flashbacks that hint at Joe s past Rather than explicitly explaining what these brief snippets are actually about the audience is invited to think about it for themselves and how these circumstances could have led Joe onto the path he is now pursuing The achingly beautiful final scene leaves us with a glimmer of hope but a large amount of uncertainty Gritty thought provoking and intensely fascinating Midnight Cowboy is one for the ages
0	I suppose all the inside jokes is what made Munchies a cult classic I thought it was awful though given the ridiculous story and the nature of the characters it probably could ve been a much better and funnier movie Maybe all they needed was a real budget Munchies as many viewers have pointed out already is something of a Gremlins parody Hence all the references to the movie The movie begins somewhere in Peru during an archeological dig An annoying dufus named Paul aspiring stand up comedian who offers no sarcasm or witty jokes during the movie despite his career plans is holed up with his dad in the caves His dad is an unconventional kind of archeologist searching the caves not for artificats or mummies or anything but proof of U F O s And that s where the Munchies come into the picture Hidden in the crevice of a rock is an ugly little mutant that looks like a gyrating rubber doll with a Gizmo voice They name him Arnold stash him in a bag and bring him home so Paul s dad can finally show proof of extra terrestrial life Paul the idiot that he is breaks his promise to his dad to watch Arnold a wager he made with his dad if he loses it s off to community college to get a real career The creepy next door neighbor with the bad rug Cecil television veteran Harvey Korman wonders what his neighbors are up to So he and his lazy son some airhead hippie type who looks more like they should ve made his character a biker or heavy metal enthusiast to go and snatch Arnold Why A get rich quick scheme of course And of course even Cecil s son is too dumb to look after Arnold And after a few pokes and prods at Arnold he multiplies into more Munchies This wasn t even a movie that was so bad it was good It was just plain awful I was hoping that the Munchies would ve mutated and killed the morons that were always after them even Paul and his girlfriend At least it would be one way to get rid of all the bad acting in this movie that really hams up the movie Not to mention poor special effects that look like hand puppets And really bad writing all around it wasn t even funny not even that young cop who can really give you the homicidal twitch in your eye Like I said Munchies if they had been given an actual budget and better actors they might ve been able to pull off a good parody Pass
0	This series had potential but I suppose the budget wouldn t allow it to see that potential An interesting setup not dissimilar to lost it falls flat after the st episode The whole series episodes could have made a compelling minute film but the makers chose to drag it on and on Many of the scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward The music was very annoying and did not work overall There were few characters we cared about as their characters did not grow during the time frame well one grew a bit The ending was as terrible as the rest of series The only kudos here is to the art dept and set dressers they created an interesting look too bad the writer and director lacked the foresight to do something interesting with that element
0	I ve read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde and this is definitely MORE accurate than the Beatty Dunaway version in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow and the capture of his wife Blanche This actress looks looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of Blanche grieving over her dying husband However this movie is still Hollywood and our anti heroes stay pretty to the end even after being shot full of holes in life Bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous ambush and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death The script is tedious and the acting is poor particularly the leads Very disappointing Stick with Beatty and Dunaway Their s may not be the true story but it s a great film
1	I loved the movie but like everyone said there were some bits that weren t developed enough I thought personally that the girls were very vapid before they landed in prison sure they were supposed to be innocent American girls but still I felt like they lacked that bond that best friends are supposed to have For example in the montage where they re sight seeing the way they held each other for the photograph was very awkward looking Then there are some parts that were very ambiguous I think it s pretty much understood that Danes character didn t do it but I can see how that could be confusing Also why did the camera dwell on Manat bearing a very grim expression after he put the bags in their taxi trunk I thought it was suggesting something but it turned out to be nothing Apart from that the movie was great I cried when Claire Danes took the blame she s a GREAT actress Also I wanted to see that bitchy Thai inmate get her ass kicked Talk about lack of closure
0	This anime series starts out great Interesting story exciting events interesting characters beautifully rendered and executed Not everything is explained right away dangling a proverbial carrot before the viewer enticing the viewer to watch each succeeding episode But imagine the disappointment to find that the sci fi thriller giant robot adventure is only a backdrop for psycho babble and quasi religious preachy exploitation If you want to hear You re OK It s good to be you after being embattled with negative slogans and the characters negative emotions then this is for you If you want a good sci fi flick that is simply fun to watch forget this one Both the original and the alternate endings were grossly disappointing to me All that AND this movie was too preachy

1	Superb comic farce from Paul Mazursky Richard Dreyfuss plays Jack Noah a fairly successful actor who is On location shooting a film in a fictitious Latin American banana republic Parador Ruled by the Fascist Alfonse Sims who unfortunately has succumbed of a heart attack after indulging in too many local cocktails Raul Julia plays the oily chief of police who forces the reluctant Noah To impersonate the Just deceased dictator who Noah bears a remarkable resemblance Sonia Braga plays the dictator s glamorously lusty mistress who gives Noah a few lessons in how to act like a dictator Jonathan Winter s literally rounds off the cast as a CIA man In Parador posing as a hammock salesman Can Noah win over the people of Parador and hold off the rebels And give the performance of a lifetime without losing his in the process Sammy Davis Jnr has a cameo as himself who amusingly croons the national anthem of Parador as well as Begin the Beguine Frog Number one Fernando Rey pops up as a kindly servant Charo is also on hand as A busty maid The score by Maurice Jarre is excellent
1	I watched the movie while recovering from major surgery While I knew it was only a B film a space western I loved it It may have lacked the flash of high dollar productions it non the less held my imagination and provided great escapism Sadly our society has so much available discounting small attempts is too easy In the same way that I can enjoy a even a grade school performance of Shakespeare I can appreciate many levels of achievement for the art sake I am a cop and found affinity with the retired LAPD Dreams like his haunt me that I will be unable in the moment of crisis be able to respond to save another s life or my own while it was a romantic ending where Farnsworth did take out the bad guy predictable I needed a little happy romance where good can triumph My world is really too cynical
1	The anime that got me hooked on anime Set in the year hey that s not too far away now the Earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence Seeing as how crimes are happening ever seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists the government of the fictional New Port City form the Tank Police to deal with the problem cops with tanks Oh the insanity The heroes of this series include the new recruit Leona Ozaki a red haired Japanese woman yeah I know they never match their distinctly Japanese names with a Japanese appearance who has just been drafted into the Tank Police and is quickly partnered with blond blue eyed nice guy Al Leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of Tank Police Commander Charles Britain also known as Brenten a big guy who looks like Tom Selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses a big revolver and a bad temper Britain didn t like having Leona join the Tank Police in the first place and her wrecking his Tiger Special a giant green monster tank doesn t exactly endear her to him nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini tank that she nicknames Bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare where the boys are more your size as he puts it There s also Specs the bifocal genius Bible quoting God fearing Chaplain purple MO hawked Mohican and the pot bellied Chief who s right on the edge thanks to the Mayor always yelling at him about the Tank Police antics Seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them they re not very well liked by the people The villains are a cyborg named Buaku who s got a mysterious past that s connected with a project known as Green Peace his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks Anna Uni Puma In the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who haven t been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the nd they re hired to steal a painting that is of a naked Buaku The story however was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic Manga book that s very hard to find All sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred This is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it you d better go get Quentin Tarantino Uneven in places but still a lot of fun Followed by New Dominion Tank Police
1	is in many ways a lost year in motion pictures Just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre sound was coming in and while reaping great profits at the box office was setting the art of film making back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technology Show People is one of the great silent era comedies The film shows that William Haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him learns his lesson and then redeems himself by winning the football game the polo game etc This movie is also exhibit A for illustrating that Marion Davies was no Susan Alexander Kane She had excellent comic instincts and timing This film starts out as the Beverly Hillbillies like adventure of Peggy Pepper Marion Davies and her father General Marmaduke Oldfish Pepper fresh from the old South General Pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress While at the studio commissary the Peppers run into Billy Boone William Haines a slapstick comedian He gets Peggy an acting job She s unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick but she perseveres Eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and Billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles Soon the new found fame goes to her head and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man whom she doesn t really love unless fate somehow intervenes One of the things MGM frequently does in its late silent era films and in its early sound era films is feature shots of how film making was done at MGM circa This film is one of those as we get Charlie Chaplin trying to get Peggy s autograph an abundance of cameos of MGM players during that era including director King Vidor himself and even a cameo of Marion Davies as Peggy seeing Marion Davies as Marion Davies arriving at work on the lot Peggy grimaces and mentions that she doesn t care for her Truly a delight from start to finish this is a silent that is definitely worth your while This is one of the films that I also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible
0	The finale of the Weissmuller Tarzan movies is a rather weak one There are a few things that derail this film First Tarzan spends much of the film wearing floppy sandals In my opinion any footwear on Tarzan whether it be sandals or boots as sometimes portrayed takes away from the character which is supposed to be anti civilization and pro jungle Second the character of Benji as mentioned in a previous post totally derails the movie as the comic foil To me his character is unnecessary to the film s plot Also while Weissmuller still cuts a commanding figure as Tarzan it s apparent that he was not in his best shape Although in his later Jungle Jim movies his physique had improved somewhat from this film The octopus battle is a terrific idea but I think it should have been done in an earlier Weissmuller film when he was at his physical peak Likewise the battle which takes only seconds tops would be much more thrilling if it was drawn out to seconds to minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in Tarzan and His Mate And while Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian as Mara are overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye it doesn t manage to salvage this last Weissmuller film a disappointing ending to a great character run
0	I rented this film to see what might be a bloody non stop action movie and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action drama that makes Kickboxer look like Die Hard Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and as Lou saves Reb from the gooks he gets shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever The Vietnam scenes are shot in someones backyard I swear Lou is now brain damaged and Reb and him live together and own a bar Super homoerotic Lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and Reb goes on a killing spree to get him back There is no good fight scenes at all the punches are two inches away from a person Characters personalities change in matter of seconds One guy is a bad and in the next scene he s good The acting is horrid and the music is some overly sentimental Frank Stallone sounding song that would make you sick I hated this film
1	Despite a tight narrative Johnnie To s Election feels at times like it was once a longer picture with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved Some of these are dealt with in the truly excellent and far superior sequel Election Harmony is a Virtue but it s still a dependably enthralling thriller about a contested Triad election that bypasses the usual shootouts and explosions though not the violence in favour of constantly shifting alliances that can turn in the time it takes to make a phone call It s also a film where the most ruthless character isn t always the most threatening one as the chilling ending makes only too clear one can imagine a lifetime of psychological counselling being necessary for all the trauma that one inflicts on one unfortunate bystander Simon Yam all too often a variable actor but always at his best under To s direction has possibly never been better in the lead not least because Tony Leung s much more extrovert performance makes his stillness more the powerful
1	Very slick very Pre Hays Code and still very sassy I would highly recommend seeing this movie even if you are not a fan of Stynwyck She s funny she s sexy she s hard working and love that perm she gets Barbara Stynwyck is fantastic as a doozie of a floozy who rises up in the world perfectly portrayed by a bank building John Wayne in a suit plays one of her first conquests The last three minutes are a letdown but the sets the lines the clothes all add to one heck of a movie about rising vertically in the horizontal position
0	Not sure why this movie seems to have gotten such rave reviews While watching Bang one night on TV I found myself bored by the nonsensical random plot which was occurring on screen The entire movie seems to be nothing more than an exercise in meaningless artsy fartsy self indulgence on the part of the filmmaker The fact that the director writer goes by a one name moniker only reinforces this sense of pretentiousness Those interested in indie flicks would be better off looking for something better written and dare I say more entertaining than this complete waste of time
1	The Last Wave is one of those movies that relies heavily on the mind The title refers to the Aboriginal doomsday theory there will be one last wave that wipes out everything David Burton Richard Chamberlain is a Sydney lawyer hired to defend some Aborigines accused of murder Around this time there has been unusually heavy rainfall in Australia While defending the Aborigines David learns the last wave theory and begins to wonder whether it s just mythology The movie s last sequence is a metaphor for descending into the depths of one s mind Peter Weir created a perplexing but thought provoking movie Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil whom you may have seen in Walkabout Crocodile Dundee and Rabbit Proof Fence provides an interesting supporting role as one of the defendants If you get a chance watch the making of feature on the DVD Peter Weir explains some of the film s undertones some of which relate to Richard Chamberlain s background
0	The viewer leaves wondering why he bothered to watch this one or why for that matter anyone bothered to make it There is no plot just random scenes of ridiculous action Mia Sara s shower scene appeals to the male libido but that s not much reason to make a movie
0	Hey HULU com is playing the Elvira late night horror show on their site and this movie is their under the Name Monsteroid good fun to watch Elvira comment on this Crappy movie Have Fun with bad movies Anyways this movie really has very little value other than to see how bad the s were for horror flicks Bad Effects Bad Dialog just bad movie making Avoid this unless you want to laugh at it While you are at HULU check out the other movies that are their right now there is episodes and some are pretty decent movies with good plots and production and you can watch a lot of them in p as long as you have a decent speed connection
0	I grew up watching and loving TNG I just recently finished watching the entire series ST Voyager on DVD which may have heightened my sense of disgust with this episode as the difference in style and approach between the two shows couldn t be more stark The idea may have been good if used as an opportunity to further expand Riker s character which is how it probably would have been treated on VOY They could have featured memories that would be new to the audience rather than simply regurgitating old show clips The in and out transitions between the memories and the present in this episode start as clich in the beginning and very quickly become intolerable as the tired pattern wears on and on Bar none worst episode ever
0	Everything a great documentary could be Yeah if one is deaf dumb and blind Everything but meaning wit visual style and interesting subject matter Aside from that Seriously volken This is a movie that is completely inauthentic An adventure doc with no adventure a war doc with no feeling for war a campy send up with no trace of wit It means nothing feels like nothing and carries the implicit message that absolutely nothing matters No wonder it has so many IMDb fans Of course going in you know a movie starring the great Skip Lipman will have no culture no intelligence no wit other than a corrosive adolescent jokiness and no recognizable human emotion just adrenaline Darkon isn t a movie it s a panic attack Avoid There too many real documentaries and too little time in life to waste it on toilet build up such as Darkon
1	Spoiler This is a great film about a conure He goes through quite the ordeal trying to get back to his little girl owner He learns a lot through his journey and meets up with a lot of other beautiful birds If you love birds like my wife does this film is for you This film also has some sad parts that make the tears run In the end it all works out for Paulie and his Russian friend Rent this for the whole family everyone will enjoy this
0	I think that movie can t be a Scott s film That is impossible Do you remember Blade Runner And Alien Two greats movies versus a one I hope didn t see ever it good bye
0	Flight of Fury starts as General Tom Barnes Angus MacInnes organises an unofficial test flight of the X a new stealth fighter jet with the ability to literally turn invisible General Barnes gives his top pilot Colonel Ratcher Steve Toussaint the job everything goes well until the X disappears even more literally than Barnes wanted as Ratcher flies it to Northern Afghanistan delivers it to a terrorist group known as the Black Sunday lead by Peter Stone Vincenzo Nicoli who plans to use the X to fly into US airspace undetected drop some bombs which will kills lots of people General Barnes is worried by the loss of his plane sends in one man army John Sands co writer executive producer Steven Seagal to get it back kill all the bad guy s in the process This American British Romanian co production was directed by Michael Keusch was the third film in which he directed Seagal after the equally awful Shadow Man Attack Force luckily someone decided the partnership wasn t working an unsuspecting public have thankfully been spared any further collaboration s between the two Apparently Flight of Fury is an almost scene for scene word for word remake of Black Thunder starring Michael Dudikoff with many of the same character s even sharing the same name so exactly the same dialogue could be used without the makers even having to change things like names although I must admit I have never seen Black Thunder therefore cannot compare the two Flight of Fury is a terrible film the poorly made written waste of time that Seagal specialises in these days It s boring even though it s not that slow the character s are poor it s full of clich s things happen at random the plot is poor the reasoning behind events are none existent it s a very lazy production overall as it never once convinces the viewer that they are anywhere near Afghanistan or that proper military procedures are being followed The action scenes are lame there s no real excitement in it the villains are boring as are the heroes it s right down there with the worst Seagal has made Flight of Fury seems to be made up largely of stock footage which isn t even matched up that well the background can change peoples clothes change the area changes the sky the quality of film changes very abruptly as it s all too obvious we are watching clips from other better films spliced in Hell Seagal never even goes anywhere near a plane in this The action scenes consist of shoot outs so badly edited it s hard to tell who is who of course Seagal breaking peoples arms The whole production feels very cheap shoddy The IMDb reckons this had a budget of about which I think is total rubbish I mean if so where did all the money go Although set in Afghanistan which is a war torn arid desert Flight of Fury looks like it was filmed down my local woods it was actually shot in Romania the Romanian countryside does not make a convincing Afghanistan The acting is terrible as one would expect Seagal looks dubbed again Flight of Fury is a terrible action film that is boring amateurish is an almost scene for scene remake of another film anyway Another really lazy poorly produced action thriller from Seagal why do I even bother any more
1	One question that must be asked immediately is Would this film have been made if the women in it were not the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis The answer is Probably not But thankfully they are or were the cousin and aunt of Jackie This documentary by the Maysles brothers on the existence one could hardly call it a life of Edith B Beale Jr and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale Edie has the same appeal of a train wreck you don t want to look but you have to Big Edith and Little Edie live in a once magnificent mansion in East Hampton New York that is slowly decaying around them The once beautiful gardens are now a jungle Magnificent oil painting lean against the wall with cat feces on the floor behind them and beautiful portraits of them as young women vie for space on the walls next to covers of old magazines Living alone together for many years has broken down many barriers between the two women but erected others Clothing is seems to be optional Edie s favorite costume is a pair of shorts with panty hose pulled up over them and bits and pieces of cloth wrapped and pinned around her torso and head As Edith says Edie is still beautiful at And indeed she is There are times when she is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that once was there There is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension Their eating habits are to be polite strange Ice cream spread on crackers A dinner party for Edith s birthday of Wonder Bread sandwiches served on fine china with plastic utensils Time is irrelevant in their world as Edie says I don t have any clocks Their relationships with men are oh so strange Edie feels like Edith thwarted any of her attempts at happiness She says If you can t get a man to propose to you you might as well be dead To which Edith replies I ll take a dog any day It is obvious that Edith doesn t see her role in Edie s lack of male companionship Early in the film she states France fell but Edie didn t Sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said Both women talk at the same time and constantly contradict each other There is a strange relationship with animals throughout the film Edie feeds the raccoons in the attic with Wonder Bread and cat food The cats and there are many of them are everywhere At one point Edie declares The hallmark of aristocracy is responsibility But they seem to be unable to take responsibility for themselves This is a difficult film to watch but well worth the effort
0	Very disappointing film By the end I no longer cared for any of the characters I did enjoy seeing Ving Rhames in a very small part and William Macy was good as always still not worth watching It starts out strong and just keeps getting weaker and weaker Insomniacs will like it as I am sure it will put them to sleep
0	I never much liked the Myra movie tho I appreciate how it pushed the Hollywood envelope at the time Certainly Miss Welch s costume became an iconic image though I have to wonder if many people who recognize the image really saw the film and know what it was all about I rewatched Myra on FMC a couple of years ago and didn t think it had aged any better thru the years There s a segment about it in the Sexploitation Cinema Cartoon History comic books where it s given proper credit for putting such big stars in what was then an outrageous production However IMHO the movie is too bitter to be charming too silly to be a turn on and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform engage OR entertain
0	I watched this film because I m a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix I thought I would give their sister a try Rain Phoenix I regret checking it out She was embarrasing and the film just has this weird plot if thats what you want to call it Sissy was just weird and Jellybean just sits on a toilet who both sleep with this old man in the mountains whats going on I have never been so unsatisfied in my life It was just total rubbish I can t believe that the actors agreed to do such a waste of film money time and space Have Sissy being beautiful didnt get to me I thought she was everything but that Those thumbs were just stupid and why do we care if she can hitchhike WHATS THE POINT out of shame the poll doesnt have a doesnt even deserve a Hopefully Rain is better in other films I forgive her for this one performance I mean I wouldnt do much better with that film
1	I was going to give it an but since you people made out of a lot better votes I had to up my contribution The river Styx was pure genius Sure Woody was his perennial stuff but at least his role was appropriate The first half hour was really hilarious and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch The dialog was clever enough and Woody s card tricks at the parties along with the reaction from the upper crust were fun to watch This was much better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be And a plus a little Sorcerer s Apprentice to go along with it And of course did you notice that Johansen is getting a bit frumpy Charles Dance is always entertaining as was Hugh Jackman
1	Let s Bowl started out on local television in the Twin Cities It came on late at night something you d stumble across while channel surfing after your th bottle of Hamm s Even the ads were locally produced featuring Wally outside Grumpy s Bar holding a microphone and stammering nervously Ahh over to you Steve Sedahl Not sure why but that one always made me laugh There was a bowling contest featured under the guise of settling a dispute between two bowlers but the game was secondary to the commentary and clips Sedahl played it straight counter balanced by Rich Kronfeld s bizarre and hilarious Wally Hotvedt Highlights included segments like How to Properly Dispose of an Old Bowling Ball chuck them into a lake and Tips on Dating where the duo date a couple of hookers and Wally ends with the bitter complaint I could have done that myself Another segment what the duo did on their days off featured Steve in beer can strewn hovel pigging out from the fridge while Wally struggled to climb the cliffs at Taylor s Falls dressed in his tight pale blue blazer and over sized headphones Hilarious Wally s awestruck comments about league bowlers and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various splits were also highlights Let s Bowl was picked up by Comedy Central and had some good moments but the network never really knew what to do with it running it during prime time and emphasizing the bowling competition which was never the point of the show The constant commercials interrupted the flow and the side characters Ernie the Pig Butch etc were more distractions than anything else The whole thing seemed rushed and kind of forced Even Jon Stewart dissed Let s Bowl on the Daily Show not enough lame snide jokes an ignominious treatment for a show that deserved far better How often does a Let s Bowl come along in the world of modern television a locally flavored mix of comedic genius and total crap The networks have the total crap part down cold but it s a sad thing to watch them kill such a dark strange funny little gem like Let s Bowl Here s hoping they ll put it out on DVD
0	Oh it really really is I ve seen films that I disliked more due to whatever reason but never have I seen a film that just fails in every single aspect of film making It even fails to fail at film making in a Way the Hercules in New York could be said to do It s not the film I like the least but it is the very worst film I ve ever seen The acting is the first thing that strikes you I ve never seen a worse acted film outside of pornography In fact I ve plenty of pornographic films that are acted a damn site better than this It really is awful Technically it s terrible The camera work is amateurish The editing is nonsensical I presume they couldn t afford proper sound equipment and this meant that every scene in a car and there s a lot of them has them driving at about three miles per hour and every scene set outside by the same patch of woods and there s a lot of them too is actually dubbed from a studio again lending more to the bad porn vibe The plot is nonsensical as many have pointed out I ll defend vampires walking in daylight by the fact that despite it being popularized by Nosferatu this was never originally an intrinsic part of the vampire mythos Speaking of vampire mythos the writer had evidently read Carmilla or at very least seen The Vampire Lovers I m not sure how I feel about this swaying from impressed that a movie this dire has at least some aspirations to a Gothic novel I m very fond of or annoyed by its at best sledgehammer references and at worst total desecration of source material At very least the General is an insult to Peter Cushing though It gets two stars however merely because I can t bring myself to vote one star for a film that has or at least purports to have both vampires and zombies in it Incidentally I watched Lifeforce another film that tenuously has vampires and zombies in it on the same day as this and despite being a rather flawed film itself really comes out a masterpiece compared to this So in the end this is not a film so bad it s good or so bad it s in any way enjoyable even drunk It s just a mess and worth no one s time watching
1	This is the Neil Simon piece of work that got a lot of praises The Odd Couple is a one of a kind gem that lingers within You got Felix Ungar Jack Lemmon a hypochondriac fussy neat freak and a big thorn in the side of his roommate Oscar Madison Walter Matthau a total slob These men have great jobs though Felix is a news writer and Oscar is a sports writer Both of these men are divorced Felix s wife is nearby while Oscar s is on the other side of the U S The West Coast Well what can you say Two men living in one roof together without driving each other crazy is impossible as well as improbable It s a whole lot of laughs and a whole lot of fun I liked the part where when those two British neighbors that speak to both gentlemen and after Oscar kicked out Felix he gets lucky and lives with them when he refused to have dinner with them the night earlier It s about time that Felix needed to lighten up I guess all neat freaks neat to lighten up They can be fussy yet they should be patient as well A very fun movie and a nuevo classic Neil Simon s The Odd Couple is a must see classic movie STARS
0	And after seeing this pile of crap you won t be surprised that it wasn t published SPOILERS This is a terrible movie by any standards but when I point out that it s one of the worst movies that has the name Stephen King in the credits you can start to imagine how bad it is The movie starts of with two characters staring open mouthed at a scene of horror My god What happened here I don t know but they sure hate cats The camera pans to the outside of a house where hundreds of cats are strung up dead and mutilated Boy this guy is right someone does hate cats and with a deduction like that he should be a policeman Oh wait a minute he is a policeman and when a movie starts with a cop making an oh so obvious observation you just know you re going to be watching a bad movie The reason SLEEPWALKERS is bad is that it s very illogical and confused We eventually find out the monsters of the title need the blood of virgins to survive Would they not be better looking for a virgin in the mid west bible belt rather than an American coastal town Having said that at least we know of the monsters motives That s the only thing we learn We never learn how they re able to change shape or are able to make cars become invisible and this jars with the ending that seems to have been stolen from THE TERMINATOR Monster mother walks around killing several cops with her bare hands or blowing them up via a police issue hand gun but if her monster breed is immune from police fire power then why do the creatures need the ability to change shape or become invisible The demise of the creatures is equally ill thought out as there killed by a mass attack of household cats If they can be killed by cats then why did the monsters not kill all the cats that were lying around the garden There was a whole horde of moggies sitting around but the monsters never thought about killing them I guess that s so the production team can come up with an ending It was that they started the movie my complaint lies We re treated to several scenes where famous horror movie directors like John Landis Clive Barker and even Stephen King make cameos I think the reason for this is because whenever a struggling unknown actor read the script they instantly decided that no matter what they weren t going to appear in a movie this bad so Stephen King had to phone up his horror buddies in order to fill out the cast That s how bad SLEEPWALKERS is Unbelievable as it seems that wasn t the worst line in the movie The worst line is That cat saved my life
0	This is one of the weakest soft porn film around I can t believe somebody wrote this stupid story before making some changes The guy Mike is a major wimp and moron I can t believe he didn t want to take a shower with his bride to be Toni and be in a threesome with the french photographer Jan He does do a threesome with Toni and Kristi but that was short I hate that every time in Soft Core Porn Films threesomes between a woman a man and a woman is short but a girl girl thing is about an hour To the makers of these films have the threesomes alot longer this film should ve have two threesome scenes not one but two
